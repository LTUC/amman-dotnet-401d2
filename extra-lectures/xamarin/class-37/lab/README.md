# Lab: Xamarin: Device Features


## Sprint 1: Milestone 2

In this milestone, we'll be saving and re-using data

## Requirements

1. Accept some form of user input
1. Save data to the device
1. Retrieve and use that data in your app

### Examples

- A form which asks for the user's name, which will then allow the app to say "Welcome back, `<name>`" whenever the user re-launches the app
- A logging system that tracks the total distance travelled by the phone in a given day/hour/minute
- A game that saves high scores
- A voting app that keeps tally whenever the user makes a selection
