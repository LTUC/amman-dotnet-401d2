# Facilitators Guide: Xamarin

## Overview

Xamarin lets you build native apps for Android, iOS, and macOS using .NET code and platform-specific user interfaces. Xamarin.Forms allows you to build native apps, with shared UI code written in C# or XAML.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
This is the beginning of a new module, focusing on Mobile/Native development with Xamarin

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be getting up and running with a basic Xamarin development kit, device emulators and a basic "Hello World" style application

**Where we're headed**:
In the next class, we will focus on Xamarin forms and saving data to the device

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to get the students up and running in the Xamarin environment.

## Preparation

- Read up on ...
- Practice The Demo

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Code Review

### TOPIC 1

This is an excellent opportunity to do your demo workshop or mob-programming style with the students. Because the demos are short, everyone should be able to follow along and enter their own lab time with a working self-written demo.

## Lab Notes

The students will be working on a 4-session solo project using Xamarin, beginning today. We'll be giving them some very basic tools over the next 3 lectures, but the real point is for them to explore and experiment.

## What might students struggle with today?

- Getting the simulators up, running, and connected. Especially iOS, if the students are on Windows machines.

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
