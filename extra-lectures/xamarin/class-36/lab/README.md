# Lab: Xamarin

## Sprint 1: Milestone 1

In our first milestone, we'll be getting our Xamarin Mobile application designed and scaffolded

## Requirements

### Idea

Decide on an idea for a mobile application that has the following features:

1. Runs natively on a mobile device
1. Can save data to the device, based on user input
   - i.e. Settings, Name, Log Data, etc
1. Takes advantage of one native device hardware feature
   - i.e. Camera, Accelerometer,  Magnitometer, GPS, etc

### Design

Design your mobile application using a visual workflow (images of each screen) to show how you'll design the screens as well as how a user will interact with the application

### Scaffold

Create the core mobile app and run it on your device

1. All screens and navigation between them are created and working
1. Apply some level of basic style/colors
1. You should endeavor to "match your design" as closely as possible

> It's not required for your app to "work" at this stage, merely to be bootable and runnable in the most basic form (pages and navigation)
