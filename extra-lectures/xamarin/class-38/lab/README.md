# Lab: Xamarin: Device Features

## Sprint 1: Milestone 3

In this milestone, we'll be using a native device feature to add some dynamism to our application

## Requirements

1. Use one native feature of your users' device to receive input or change state

### Examples

- GPS to note coordinates
- Accelerometer to note how fast we are moving
- Gyrometer to note phone location on the x/y/z axis
- Take and use a picture
- Haptic Input (how hard am I pressing)
- Haptic Feedback (buzzing and such)
