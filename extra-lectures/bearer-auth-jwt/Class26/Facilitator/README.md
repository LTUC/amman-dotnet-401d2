# Facilitators Guide: Intro to Identity

## Overview

Today we will learn about .NET Core's identity API. It's a pretty big package, but it will help us keep our site secure and allow users to have a personalized experience. Today, the students will:

1. Create a database just for data
2. Create a database for their user information
3. Enable Identity
4. Scaffold out the basics of an app to prepare for future labs.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
We are just getting off of project week

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be looking into Authentication and Authorization into our site. 

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will add the abiltiy to create user accounts, logins, and create JWT tokens. 

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are to refresh the student's memory on apis as well as introduce to them the concept of a web app having more than one database. it is possible. 

## Preparation

- Read up on the MSFT docs of identity.
- Get ready for questions about login and registrations (it's coming in the next class!)

- Practice [the demo](../demo/demo-name) on whatever.

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Code Review

- No Code Review. This can be skipped today since they are just getting off of Project Week. 

### Identity

- **Why** (5 min)
  - We need the ability to personalize a user's experience on websites. We need to be able to keep information secure so that users will trust to use our site. We need the ability to know who is who and give permissions accordingly. 
- **What** (10 min)
  - See the `Identity.md` file
- **How** (30 min)
  - See the demo file
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Keep Iterating on the buildout of the app. Show them as many error message as possible. 

## Lab Notes

- This lab can be paired, it will help them divide and conquer the work a bit more fluently.  Most of this lab is a review from weeks 3 and 4, as well as setting them up for the rest of the week. 

## What might students struggle with today?

- Remembering everything from before project week.
