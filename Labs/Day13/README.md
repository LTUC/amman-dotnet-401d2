## Directions
Building off of your project from the previous 2 classes, Add a Model to your MVC application.
This model should hold the basic properties of the information you are trying to capture.

To 'save' this data, instead of using an external text file, save the data entered through an
in-memory collection of objects using Model Binding. Include input validation in all fields as well. 

Update your applicaiton as neccesary so that the Model, View, and Controller layout 
is properly configured.

If you have time, make changes to your app to improve functionality as you see fit.
