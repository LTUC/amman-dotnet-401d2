=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- write all of your code in a branch named `lab-#`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab04-amanda`
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas

## Directions

- Using the Object Oriented Principles (OOPs) you learned today (Inhertiance and Abstraction)
- Build out the hierarchical class structure of a zoo. There should be at least 3 layers of inheritance with at least 6 different types of animals. 
- Show inheritance by using `Console.WriteLine()` as neccesary to prove that a methods were propertly implemented or inherited.
    - Examples include: `Eat()` `Sleep()` `Sound()` etc... 
    - You are allowed to use these example methods, along with others not listed
- Be sure to include a diagram with your solution of how your zoo is mapped out. 
- Label the abstract methods and classes as neccesary and be sure to clearly show the inheritance levels. 

## Components
- Have at least 3 different abstract classes
- Have at least 3 layers of inheritance
- Have at least 3 abstract methods (each in different classes)
- Each class you define should have at least 3 methods in it.

- Your drawing of your zoo diagram should be clearly labeled of which classes
- To 'prove' your inheritance, use `Console.WriteLine()` to output to the console.

## ReadMe
- Your readme should include the following information:
	- How long did it take you to complete this assignment?
	- What did you struggle with? Why? How did you solve?
	- What did you learn during this assignment?
    - What resources did you utilize for this assingment?
