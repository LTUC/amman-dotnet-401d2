## Directions

- Using the Object Oriented Principles (OOPs) you learned today (Inhertiance and Abstraction)
- Build out the class structure of a zoo. There should be at least 3 layers of inheritance with at least 3 different types of animals. 
- Show inheritance by using `Console.WriteLine()` as neccesary to prove that a method was overritten and properly inherited.
    - Examples include: `Eat()` `Sleep()` `Sound()` etc... 
    - You are allowed to use these example methods, along with others not listed
- Be sure to include a diagram with your solution of how your zoo is mapped out. 
- Label the abstract methods as neccesary and be sure to clearly show the inheritance levels.
