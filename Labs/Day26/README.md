## Directions
This lab will span over the course of 4 days. You will be building out your portfolio to showcase your projects
and experience. At the end of the week, your final submission should contain the project completed as a whole, along with a deployment
link to Azure. 
<br /> <br />

** Everyday's lab is dependant upon what we completed in class. Check back every day for the updated assignment.**

### Day 1
- Build out the beginning of your Portfolio site, using Razor Pages architecture

## ReadMe
A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to

1. tell them what it is (with context)
2. show them what it looks like in action
3. show them how they use it
4. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> <br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo for an example.
