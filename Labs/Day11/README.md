## Directions
This is the first of a 4 part applicaiton build out. You will be creating a
web appliction for a student enrollment center. Using everything you've learned so far
and query strings and controllers build out at least 2 controllers with each controller containing at least 3 actions.
The application needs to have a page to register students, and another page to view all 
students who have registered so far. Use attribute routing to clean up the URLS, 
and have at least one custom URL in each controller. Be sure to have a default controller set 
in the configuration.

**Note**: We are only practing using controllers in this lab assignment. 
there is no need to create views or models just yet.
