## Directions
In this series, we will be building an infrastructure for a Travel packing site.
The applicaiton should assist users in helping them decide what they should pack
when going on vacation. Within the application, the user can select destinations and 
a list of reccomended items will display what they should pack. 
Use the "Code First" migration approach and create a database to model data persistance.
Include a class that will 'seed the database' for default data when there is no information in the database.
