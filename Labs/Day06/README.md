=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- create a new branch named `lab01-`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab06-amanda`
- write your code
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas
- Include a Readme.md (contents described below)

## Directions
- Build a game (Think of something along the lines of Attackers vs Defenders. Get creative)
- Create it with a minimum of 2 interfaces.
	- One class should implement one interface
	- Another class to implement the other interface
	- Third class to implement both interfaces.
- Make use of each class that implements the interface. Show the classes "powers" and "restrictions"
- Test your code with Unit testing
- Use all 4 OOP principles.
- Draw a diagram out that maps out the relationships between classes.
- Label interfaces as `<interface>`
- Include the directions of the game in your readme. 

## ReadMe
A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to

1. tell them what it is (with context)
2. show them what it looks like in action
3. show them how they use it
4. tell them any other relevant details

<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> <br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo for an example.
