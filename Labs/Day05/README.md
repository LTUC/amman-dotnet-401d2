=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- create a new branch named `lab01-`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab01-amanda`
- write your code
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas
- Include a Readme.md (contents described below)

## Directions
- Build out the class structure of Code Fellows.
	- Think about the different roles: Students & Staff
	- Different Tech Stacks (.NET, Python, JavaScript)
- Create a class model using all 4 OOPs principles. 
- Be sure to include a drawn out diagram showing the relationship between your classes
- Comment within your code where each OOPs principle is being used
- Create methods in each class, No logic code is required other than `Console.WriteLine` when nececsary.

## ReadMe
A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to
1. tell them what it is (with context)
2. show them what it looks like in action
3. show them how they use it
4. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. 
Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo for an example.
