# Midterm Final Outcome

Both of your final midterm GitHub projects should contain the following:

## Source Code
This is the code of your project. Include the .sln file and source folders

Your project that is created should follow all of the required guidelines described 
[HERE](ProjReqs.md){:target="_blank"} 

## Tests
Tests are important. Write tests that cover basic getters/setters of your models, as well as CRUD operations within your functionality. 


## ReadMe
Your readme should contain the following:
1. Link to your deployed site
1. Introduction to your project (What is it? Why should you use it? What is it's purpose?)
1. Screenshots of what your project looks like
1. If an API, data examples of how to setup/use (in addition, link to the api/swagger documentation)
1. Database Schema (clean digital drawing)
1. WireFrames. 
1. DB Schema breakdown/explanation
1. Tools you used (VSTS, Visual Studio, Swagger, etc...)
1. Contributors
1. MIT License

## Software Requirements Doc
1. The Software Reqs doc can live in the Web App Repo. 
This should be the same reqs doc that you completed for your midterm prework. 
This should be named `Requirements.md`

## Documentation (API Only)
The API Team should have ***clear and concise*** documenation on the API endpoints. This should 
contain information such as 

1. Name of the endpoint/route
1. Possible accepted data
1. Examples and code snippets of requests/responses

Here are some options:
1. Use [Swagger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger?view=aspnetcore-2.1){:target="_blank"}  (strongly preferred)
2. Create your custom documentation
