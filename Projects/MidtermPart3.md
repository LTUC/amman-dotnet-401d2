# Repo and VSTS
Create your GitHub Organization and a VSTS account to manage your 
project management. 

## Build your Repo
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. 
The next step for group projects is to create a repository where 
you will do your work.

### Tasks
Each group should select a team member to host the project repository. 
This member should create a new repository and add the other team members 
as collaborators, so that everyone has the right to manage the repository.

Alternatively, you may create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repository there.

As a team, decide on a git workflow you will use. Once you have chosen the workflow you will use, document this workflow using the GitHub wiki feature. Your chosen workflow should have at least:
- The ability to implement your work in isolated branches and to merge these after review
- A strategy for documenting the features, stories and tasks you wish to implement using GitHub issues or some other Agile or Kanban tool.
- A branch where a test or staging deployment may be made with merged features that may not yet be ready for production
- A branch from which a production deployment may be made at any time

## Create your VSTS account
