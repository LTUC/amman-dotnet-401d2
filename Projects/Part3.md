# Group Project: Begin Wireframes and Create a Repository

## Wireframes
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. The next step for group projects is to begin to generate wireframes for each page in your application.

### Tasks
Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website without committing any code. You can use an online or desktop tool, such as Moqups.com or Mockingbird. Or you can use paper and pen.

Storyboards combine individual wireframes into diagrams of the flow of a user through your website. As your wir frames become more complete, consider combining them into story boards that show the various ways in which a user might interact with your site. These will help to inform your creation of User Stories as preparations for project week continue.


#### Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit**
If you have created wireframes online, please submit a link to them (in progress is fine, they need not be complete yet).

If you have created pen-and-paper wireframes, take a quick picture of them and upload that.

## Build your Repo
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. The next step for group projects is to create a repository where you will do your work.

### Tasks
Each group should select a team member to host the project repository. This member should create a new repository and add the other team members as collaborators, so that everyone has the right to manage the repository.

Alternatively, you may create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repository there.

As a team, decide on a git workflow you will use. Once you have chosen the workflow you will use, document this workflow using the GitHub wiki feature. Your chosen workflow should have at least:
- The ability to implement your work in isolated branches and to merge these after review
- A strategy for documenting the features, stories and tasks you wish to implement using GitHub issues or some other Agile or Kanban tool.
- A branch where a test or staging deployment may be made with merged features that may not yet be ready for production
- A branch from which a production deployment may be made at any time

#### Submitting Your Work
**Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit**
In the text area, write the name of your project and provide a link to the repository you have created.
