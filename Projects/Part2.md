# General Project Description

For this mid-term project, you will be summarizing all of the concepts you've learned and applied in labs up to the end of the first half. Your instructional team will provide you with further specification regarding constraints and expectations for course-specific requirements. 

At this point, you should have an idea as to what's possible to create given a neads up on what your course will have covered and be capable of creating by the middle of the course. Use that knowledge to generate some ideas and discussion!

## Ideas

Project Requirements are outlined [HERE]().


## Group Project: Pitch IdeasÂ¶
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. You've been given groups, so the first step for group projects is to pitch ideas.

## Tasks
As a group, arrange a 30-60 minute time when you can all be in the same place. Lab time is ideal for this.

There will be two phases for this:

## Brainstorming Ideas
Pitching a Project
Brainstorm Ideas
Grab a whiteboard and brainstorm ideas. During this phase, there is no comment or criticism of ideas. Ideas should be given in the form of titles or very short phrases. If an explanation is needed, save it for the pitch round.

## Pitching a Project
Once a critical mass of ideas has been written down, the person who offered the idea will give a pitch. Each pitch may be no longer than 2 to 3 minutes. The purpose of a pitch is to sell the idea to your group mates. During this phase, questions may be asked, but the discussion should be limited. Keep it short and to the point.

At the end of the pitch, you should have formed a short list of favorites.


## Submitting your work
**Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit**
As a group, agree on 2 top ideas. In a doc, or in the text area below outline
