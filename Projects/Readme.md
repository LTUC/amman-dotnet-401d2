# Final Project - Friday planning

Time to kick off planning with your group! Today is the beginning of your project planning; your planning will continue on Monday. Here's what you need to accomplish (in order) today:

### Select a project
Look over the list of projects in Canvas. As a group, choose one that appeals to you. Use a whiteboard to collaboratively write out the following:
- Your project topic
- Your project pitch:
  - What is the problem you're solving?
  - What will be your solution to the problem?
  - What are the benefits to your solution?
  - You can read more about pitches  [here](https://www.bidsketch.com/proposal-resources/proposal-templates/web-design-proposal-template).

### Group agreement
Now that you've had a chance to talk some as a group, step away from the project pitch to develop a group agreement. This is a document that your group creates collaboratively; it details your expectations of how you will work with each other. It is a "living document" - that is, it can be changed as you go along to meet your group's needs as they emerge. Again, develop this collaboratively and write it down together on a whiteboard. Keep refining it until everyone in the group agrees with it. At the minimum, it should cover:
  - Communication plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?
  - Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
  - Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the C#, MVC Core Framework, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
  - Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?
  - Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.

### GitHub setup
Next up: time to get set up in GitHub.
- Make an organization on GitHub for your team.
- Invite all team members to the Organizations, as well as the instructor of the course.
- In that organization, create a repo for your project.
- In the README.md, add your group members' names, your project topic, and your project pitch.
- Add a `group-agreement.md`, with the text of your group agreement.

### Review with the instructional team
Once you have the above things done, find Amanda and present your project pitch and group agreement. This is so we can make sure you're on track and not biting off an impossible project.

### User scenarios
After you've met with Amanda, it's time to start crafting some user scenarios. Get at least halfway through your user scenarios today; you'll resume working on them on Monday. Add your user scenarios to a `user-scenarios.md` file in your repo. Remember, user scenarios give:
- the backstory of a particular user
- the context in which they'll be using your app
- why they will use your app
- what knowledge/previous experience (or lack thereof) they come to your app with
