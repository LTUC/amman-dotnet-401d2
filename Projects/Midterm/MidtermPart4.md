# Group Project: Begin Wireframes & Software Requirements

## Wireframes
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. 
The next step for group projects is to begin to generate wireframes for 
each page in your application.

### Tasks
Wireframes allow you to experiment with the look and feel of a website 
without committing any code. Create your Wireframe in a digital tool. whiteboard wireframes will not be accepted.

Provide an image of your wireframes in with the readme of your project.

## User Stories
For each application (web app and API), start out by creating at least 5 user stories for each side. The outline/requirements for user stories can be found [HERE](UserStories.md){:target="_blank"}

Each "task" or item in your kanban PM board, for each project, should contain:

1. Title
2. User Story
3. Feature Tasks
4. Acceptance Tests

Provide a link to your kanban board in your project Readme. 

## Software Requirements
Only one software requirements doc is required for your midterm, Please have it live in your front-end web app repo. The doc should take into consideration both applications (front end and API) and view it as one whole project. 
Create a markdown file in your web application project repo that defines your 
project's software requirements.

Name your doc `Requirements.md` and be sure to include all of the required information, in detail. 

The requirements for your software requirements doc can be found [HERE](SoftwareReqs){:target="_blank"} 

## Database Schema

Each application (Web app & API) should have their own DB Schema

Draft out what your database will look like by creating a schema. 
Be sure to identify which tables are:

1. 1-to-1 relationships
2. 1-to-many relationships
3. many-to-many relationships

Also, include in each table:
1. the name of column
2. The required data type

Include this DB schema in your readme, accompanied by an explanation of each table
and it's responsibility in the application. 

#### Submitting Your Work
**This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for 
group credit**

Submit your project repo with your readme outlined. 

Upon completion of your tasks listed above, notify your instructor for approval of the content. After approval, you may begin coding. All 4 project steps **must** be completed before you may start coding your project.
