# Repo and Tooling
Create your GitHub Organization and setup your tooling for project management. If you are unfamiliar with any PM tools, I would suggest a VSTS account to manage your 
project management. We will be actively using VSTS in weeks 6-9 anyway, it may be a good time for a head start. 

## Build your Repo
It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. 
The next step for group projects is to create a repository where 
you will do your work.

### Tasks
Each group should select a team member to host the project repository. 
This member should create a new repository and add the other team members 
as collaborators, so that everyone has the right to manage the repository.

Alternatively, you may create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repository there.

1. Lock down your master branch. Set a restriction on your master branch that PR's must be approved by someone other than the PR owner before it can get merged.
2. Create a branch where a test or staging deployment may be made with merged features that may not yet be ready for production
3. Apply any other relevant safeguards or processes that you mentioned in your Git Workflow from part 1 of your midterm planning.


## PM Tools
Make sure everyone has access and permissions to the PM tooling you are using. Make any appropriate or required associations or connections between Github and your tool.  

### Create your VSTS account (optional)
If you choose to use VSTS, create an account and use this tool to manage your team throughout the week.
