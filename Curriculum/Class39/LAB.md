=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- Create a new repo on your personal GitHub account
- Name your repo `Lab##-TITLE`
- write your code
- push to your repository
- submit a link to your Repo in canvas
- Include a `README.md` (contents described below)

## Directions

## User Stories & Guidance:

1. (Developer 1) As a developer, I would like to integrate Azure Blob Storage into my current project to store my product images
2. (Developer 2) As a user, I would like to upload product images to Azure Blog Storage when adding or updating a product. 


### Guidance

**User Story 1**: Utilizing what was taught in class, integrate Azure Blob Storage into your application. Consider creating a new model for BLOB storage manipulation directly.Use the demo code as an outline.  

**User Story 2**: If you don't already have a ProductsController, you will need one. This can be scaffolded out if you wish, but in the event you are not comfortable or do not like templated code, create it yourself and allow the ability to upload images directly to Azure Blob using an upload functionality.

You will need to inject `userManager` into your razor page to get basic information about the user.

## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** <br />
Here are the requirements for a valid readme: <br />

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to

1. tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
2. show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
3. show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
4. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
