# Lab 37: Sprint 3 - Milestone #4

## User Stories & Guidance:

1. (Developer 1) As a developer, I would like to have a personal profile page that will display my basic information
1. (developer 2) As a user, I would like to view my last 5 orders I have created from the site


### Guidance

**User Story 1**:Â Using .NET Core Razor Pages, create a personal profile page that a logged in user can easily access. The user profile should 
contain the ability for the user to:
1. Change their first name
1. View their email (don't let the user change it)

You will need to inject `userManager` into your razor page to get basic information about the user.


**User Story 2:** Within the user profile, the user should be able to view their last 5 orders that they have placed. Much like the admin dashboard, allow the user to view the individual details of each order.

## Tests
