# Classes Working Together

The biggest differene between Object Oriented Programming and Funcitonal Programming
is the concept of objects working together. 

Classes should be defined and setup in a manner that it doesn't matter
who called each class, or when the class was called, the behavior will 
always be the same. 

For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, the students need to see this in action,

provide for them the classes for Progam, Board, and Position and make them
complete the `Game` class. This game class should utulize the behaviors 
from the other classes to construct a tictac toe game.
