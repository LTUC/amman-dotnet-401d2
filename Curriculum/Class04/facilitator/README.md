# Class 04 : Classes and Objects

## Overview
Introduce the concept of Classes and Object Oriented Programming as well as the memory management of C#.

## How do I prep for today?
1. Upload the starter code for today's lab to the daily class repository in GitHub.
1. Be comfortable with the demo code and lecture content.

## Lecture

### Code Review

Try and keep it short today. There are a lot of topics to cover!

### Classes and Properties (90 minutes)

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Item
- **What** (10 min)
  -	Classes [Lecture](./Resources/Classes.md)
  - Properties [Lecture](./Resources/Properties.md)
- **How** (30 min)
  - Item 1
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Create different classes with properties. 
- **In-Class Exercise** (30 minutes)
  - Create a program and implement the following:
	- A "Pizza" Store Class
		- Properties that describe the store (Name, Address, Size)
		- Constructor to specify the name of the store
		- OrderPizza - -returns pizza
	- A "Pizza" Class
		- Constructor that specifies the type of pizza
		- Properties for the ingredients
		- Bake() Method
		- Cut() Method - 
		- Order() Method

  - [Lecture](./Resources/StackHeap.md)
  - [Lecture](./Resources/GarbageCollection.md)
- **How** (30 min)
  - N/A

## Lab Notes
The Lab contains starter code. This will give them a look of what a console app with many classes could potentially look like.
Provide this for them after the lecture and before they begin the lab.

The lab will require some knowledge on multi-dimensional arrays. Encourage students to look back at the prework array readings as a refresher.

## What changed from yesterday? 
- Today is the first day of "Classes". Many questions that may have come up through the week should now be answered, or at least more details provided.

## What might students struggle with today? 
- Properties are a hard concept for many to grasp. Usually the response is 
("why not just use variables and fields"). 
- Constructors are a bit confusing as well, they want to call and use them like methods. Just enforce constructors as an object requirements used to "construct" the 
object they are requesting. 
- Value Types and Reference types can be difficult to grasp along with the Stack and Heap. Draw out the stack and the references to the objects on the heap. This usually helps 
students understand the concepts a bit better.
- Students sometimes don't realize how well classes can work together, and how you can have multiple classes in a program that work together
to accomplish a task. You can remedy this by reviewing the benefits and purpose behind object oriented programming. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
N/A

## General comments
- Through the week we have been alluding to the concept of classes but never actually talked about them.. now we get to. 
You may be able to start the conversation of the class out by reviewing what they know already about classes.
