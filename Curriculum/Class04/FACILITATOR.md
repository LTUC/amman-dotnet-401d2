# Class 04

## How do I prep for today?
Introduce the concept of Classes and Object Oriented Programming
1. Classes.md
2. Properties.md

## What changed from yesterday? 
- nothing. We are switiching gears to OOP principles. 

## What might students struggle with today? 
- Properties are a hard concept for many to grasp. Usually the response is ("why not just use variables and fields") 
- Constructors are a bit confusing as well, they wnat to call and use them like methods. Just enforce constructors as an object requirement. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- n/a

## General comments
- I find it easier to describe this through diagramming a hierarchy of classes. I like to do it through a party.
There are different kinds of parties you can have (graduation, birthday etc...). Show how each of these relate to each other
and how they inherit from each other. the further down the hierarchy, the more specific we get to the type of party. This seems
to make it easier for students to understand the concept behind inheritance and abstract classes.
