# Class 04

## How do I prep for today?
Introduce the concept of Classes and Object Oriented Programming
1. Intro to OOP
1. Classes.md
1. Structs (optional lecture)
1. Properties.md

## What changed from yesterday? 
- nothing. We are switiching gears to OOP principles. 

## What might students struggle with today? 
- Properties are a hard concept for many to grasp. Usually the response is ("why not just use variables and fields") 
- Constructors are a bit confusing as well, they want to call and use them like methods. Just enforce constructors as an object requirement. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- n/a

## General comments
- Through the week we have been alluding to the concept of classes but never actually talked about them..now we get to. 
you may be able to start the conversation of the class out by reviewing what they know already about classes.
