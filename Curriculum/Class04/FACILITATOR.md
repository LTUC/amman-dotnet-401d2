# Class 04 : Classes and Objects

## How do I prep for today?
Introduce the concept of Classes and Object Oriented Programming.
A document outline for each of these sections is located in the Resources Folder
1. Open up with Classes and Properties
	1. Classes.md (Classes.md)
	1. Properties.md (Properties.md)
1. Once you review the above, Start talking about **Value Types** and **Reference Types**
and how they are different. 
	1. Value Types vs Reference Types (ValRefTypes.md)
1. Introduce the Stack and the Heap, and how they relate to val and ref types
	1. Stack // Heap (in StackHeap.md)
1. You can then wrap up with Garbage Collection. GC itself is kind of a big topic, and is
a lot to review on top of everything else that is being taught this day. So just go over the fundamentals.
You do not have to go over each generation in depth, if you think it is too much to digest. 
	1. Garbage Collection Fundamentals (in GarbageCollection.md)

The Lab will require some knowledge on multi-dimensional arrays and potentially Jagged Arrays. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
- nothing. We are switiching gears to OOP principles. 

## What might students struggle with today? 
- Properties are a hard concept for many to grasp. Usually the response is ("why not just use variables and fields") 
- Constructors are a bit confusing as well, they want to call and use them like methods. Just enforce constructors as an object requirement. 
- Value Types and Reference types can be difficult to grasp along with the Stack and Heap.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- n/a

## General comments
- Through the week we have been alluding to the concept of classes but never actually talked about them..now we get to. 
You may be able to start the conversation of the class out by reviewing what they know already about classes.
