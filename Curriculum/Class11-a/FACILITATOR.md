# Class 11: Intro to ASP.NET MVC Core

## How do I prep for today?
1. What is ASP.NET Core?
2. What is MVC?
3. How to create an MVC application

## What changed from yesterday? 
New Topic! Finally working in the web framework. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
MVC. It looks like "Magic" to them and there are a lot of 
questions about "How" and "Why". 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
I encourage the students to keep doing the motions of how to build an MVC app. a lot of it
is memorization. provide for them the steps on how to get one created (without a database).
You will provide for them the database steps tomorrow.
