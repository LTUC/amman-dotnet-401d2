# Class 19:

## How do I prep for today?

## Lecture
1. Code Review
   - Review Views, Taghelpers, Layouts, and Routes.
1. **API Calls**
	- using [This document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/console-webapiclient) as a resource, teach the students how to make an api call from a service to their Hotel Async API.
	- Make an API call to your API server. Make sure the students have:
		- Model class to mimic the dto coming in. 
		- Make note how the dto does automatic model binding that happens with the incoming DTO. 
	- Other resources: 
		- [Http Flurl](https://flurl.dev/)
		- [Rest Sharp](http://restsharp.org/)
1. **Bootstrap**
	- Ther readings from class 17 do a pretty good job at an intro, but review it with the students on how to enable it and use it within the site. 
		- [How to use Bootstrap with .NET Core](https://www.bootstrapdash.com/asp-net-core-with-bootstrap-4/)

1. Review the "right click publish" deployment to Azure. 

## Lab Notes

The lab is set to have the students finish up a frontend web app that makes calls to their api from last week. This will wrap up a clear picture of the web request response cycle as a whole. 

## General comments

Studetns will not 100% feel comfortable with the frontend, but with a little practice, they will be ready for midterms :)
