# Class 19:

## How do I prep for today?

Continue the conversation of APIs. Build out as far in the demo code as you can. A few things to make sure to cover/emphasize:
1. API servers are still using MVC. We still use controllers for routes and models to hold class data. 
2. API servers do not need views...only build out the models and controllers
3. Each Action should map to a specific end point of Get, Put, Post, Delete
4. Build out your API using the Repository Design Pattern
5. For today's demo, focus on the usage of more than one controller and 

If you are not able to complete the demo in class, it is ok to share the provided demo to the students so they can see the finished product. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
This is a build off from yesterday 2nd part of the lecture. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
Nothing "new" is being taught today. This is all review of what they learned week three for creating controllers. The biggest difference being the name of the individual actions within the controllers and the different HTTP action tags. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Sometimes Postman doesn't act as expected. This is usually due to misc updates.

## General comments

We only touch APIs for a day and a half, but it is a requirement for half of the midterm. Really emphasize how much "simplified" an API controller is from what they have been building. This day is a great way to test the student's overall knowledge of MVC and how it all relates to one another.
