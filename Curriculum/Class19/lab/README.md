# Lab 19: API Calls

## The Problem Domain

Have your application make a RESTful API call to your Async Inn Hotel API Server

## Application Specifications

Add a new controller onto your Web App named `HotelsController`.

Implement into your application the repository design pattern (add interfaces, services, and mappings)

Have this controller contain a variety of actions.
1. Action to display all the hotels
2. Action to display information about a specific hotel
3. Display information about a specific Room
4. Display the list of all amenities


Deployment to Azure (both your local app and api server)

Overall, the look and feel of your site should provide a good client experience.


## Guidance
- Use [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/console-webapiclient) as a reference on making API calls
- [Tag Helpers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-3.1)

## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** 
Here are the requirements for a valid readme:

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to

1. Tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
1. Show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
1. Show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
1. Tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
