# Lab 19: Finish up the app

## The Problem Domain

Review your current project and ensure the following is met:

1. Summary Comments on all services and interfaces
2. Test at least 2 services to ensure the CRUD operations work as expected
3. Deploy the app to Azure
4. Test your routes on Postman to confirm you are getting the correct data


## Stretch Goals

1. Add "personal profiles" for each agent
2. Allow agents to "favorite" hotels for quick access


## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** 
Here are the requirements for a valid readme:

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to

1. Tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
1. Show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
1. Show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
1. Tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
