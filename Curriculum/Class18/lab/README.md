# Lab 18: WEB App for API Calls

## The Problem Domain

Create a frontend application using ASP.NET Core MVC that makes request to an existing API

## Application Specifications

Build out an MVC Application that calls out to your previously created Async Inn API.

1. Start out with an empty web app and set up the routing and dependencies.
2. Implement into your application the repository design pattern (add interfaces, services, and mappings)
3. Set your app up to make requests for:
   - Displaying all the hotels that are in the api server's database
   - Displaying information specific to an individual hotel


Your final app should contain:
 1. Home Controller
    - Index action
    - View with navigation to view all hotels
 2. Hotels Controller
    - Action to display all the hotels
    - Action to display information about a specific hotel
 3. CSS For all pages
 4. Page layouts
 5. Deployment to Azure (both your local app and api server)

Overall, the look and feel of your site should provide a good client experience.


## Guidance
- Use [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/console-webapiclient) as a reference on making API calls
- [Tag Helpers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-3.1)

## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** 
Here are the requirements for a valid readme:

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to

1. Tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
1. Show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
1. Show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
1. Tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
