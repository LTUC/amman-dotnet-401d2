# Lab 18: WEB App for API Calls

## The Problem Domain

Create a Web app with a home page. 

## Application Specifications

1. Start out with an empty web app and set up the routing and dependencies for a default Home controller with the Index action as default. 

Using Layouts, HTML, and CSS, build out a very basic site that introduces the user to the Hotel Asset Management System. In Lab 19, we will make calls to the API Server you built previously.

Overall, the look and feel of your site should provide a good client experience.


## Guidance
- Use [this documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/console-webapiclient) as a reference on making API calls
- [Tag Helpers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-3.1)

## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** 
Here are the requirements for a valid readme:

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to

1. Tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
1. Show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
1. Show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
1. Tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
