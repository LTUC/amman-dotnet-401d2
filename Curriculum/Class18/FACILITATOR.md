# Class 18: Testing and Deployment

## How do I prep for today?

Today's topics:
1. User Secrets
1. Deployment to Azure

2. Intro to APIs


## What changed from yesterday? 
You are building off of what you have done the previous days, except this time 
creating an external app that will use the api that has been created. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
They will have to practice what they learned in week 2 when it came to converting JSON to C#. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Students struggle with the conversion of JSON to C#. it may be helpful to review that again
or provide for them some code that will accomplish what they want.

## General comments
At this point in the class, since we are so close to project week...the studetns who are
behind will likely not complete this lab. This lab for today is on a smaller scale of what the midterms
should consist of.
