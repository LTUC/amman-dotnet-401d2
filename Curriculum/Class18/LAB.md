=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- Create a branch named `NAME-FINAL`
- Write your code
- Commit often
- Push to your repository
- Create a pull request from your branch back your `master` branch.
- Submit a link to your PR in canvas
- Merge your PR back into master
- Include a `README.md` (contents described below)

## Directions

Finish up your `Async Inn` Hotel Management project:
1. Deploy to Azure (reference link in your Readme)
	- application *MUST* be deployed to Azure. No grade will be given to non-deployed apps.
2. CSS/HTML should be present on **all** pages of the project.
	- Utilize "layouts"
	- Use "partials" as needed
3. Write Tests (listed below)
4. The site should be functional, with no errors being thrown. Exceptions handled appropriately, and redirects occurring where they are needed. 


Overall, the look and feel of your site should provide a good client experience.


### Tests

1. Getters/Setters on all Models
2. Standard CRUD operations on all tables

## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** <br /> 
Here are the requirements for a valid readme: <br />

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to

1. tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
2. show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
3. show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
4. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.

## Rubric
- 35pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	35      | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution // Site contains user interface with appropraite css/html  |
	25       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors, CSS/HTML are not meeting minimum requirements|
	20       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements descibed above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	15       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements descibed above // Program runs/compiles |
	10       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 15pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	15       | Code meets Industry Standards // methods and variables namings are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are propertly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented |
	10       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments |
	5       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
