# Class 18: Testing and Deployment

## How do I prep for today?

Have an azure account ready to go that you can demonstrate how to deploy both a sql server database and app service to Azure.

## Lecture
1. Code Review
   - Review/write some tests with the class
   - Introduce User Secrets
     - In the Curriculum Resources folder, refer to the User Secrets. Walk
   the students through how to enable User Secrets before deployment 
1. Deployment to Azure
   - Follow the deployment steps to deploy to Azure. Depending on the class size, you may want
   to walk through the deployment together, ensuring the whole class is deployed by EOD. 
   - If walking through the whole process with the class is not an option, just simply show them and provide for them the deployment instructions. They can refer to those instructions afterwards when doing it on their own. 
   - Provide for them the deployment instructions...this will help them after the class is over. 
2. Intro to APIs
   - Introduce to what APIs are and talk about the basic HTTP Methods. 
   - Draw out the Web Request Response Cycle with an outline of the data being sent and received
   - Create a a simple API Controller.
   - 
## What changed from yesterday? 
Wrapping up with deployment! Starting APIs

## What might students struggle with today?  
Deployments are sometimes unpredicable.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Provide for the student the deployment instructions

## General comments
USe this day to really wrap up the "Async Inn" project. Time permitting will allow you to jump into APIs.
If you run out of time, or do not feel that they will be successful in APIs, then there is no need to teach that topic today
and push it off until Class 19.
