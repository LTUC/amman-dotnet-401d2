=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- write all of your code in a directory named `lab-#`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab42-amanda`
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas

## Directions 
- Create a new Console Application within Visual Studio 2017.
- Create a program that uses the Factory Method Design Pattern 
- This program should consist of a document/resume creation factory.
- You are creating types of **Documents** that make up a **Resume** or **Report**, that conists of different **Pages** such as **Cover Letter**, **References**, **Work History**, **Summary Page** etc...
- Identify the following. **In your readme** (hint: i bolded some of the important keywords)
    1. Product --
    2. Concrete Product (Concrete classes of the product) - 
    3. Creator --
    4. Concrete Creator (concrete objects from the creator) - 
- In your Program.cs file should clearly show through Console.WriteLines() that your program is functioning as requried.   
  

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	2       | Missing tests // tests are not passing // not enough valid tests |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors. |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // methods and variables namings are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are propertly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
