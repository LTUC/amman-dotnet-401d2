# Class 42

## How do I prep for today?
The demo code that you can build out in class is located in the Demo folder. 
This is right out of the "Head First design Patterns" book. The example is the Factory Method Pattern
and you will be building out a Pizza store. It is a fun example that makes the Factory pattern a bit easy to understand. 

## What changed from yesterday? 

## What might students struggle with today?  
The number of design patterns can sometimes overwhelm the studetns. They are not traditionalliy required to know
them all, just a small handful. They already know a few, they just may not know it yet. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
