# Deisign Patterns

## What
Software Design Patterns are common solutions to porblems which are regularly encoutnered in programming. 
These patterns focus on Object Oriented programming exclusively. Some of the Design Patterns are considered best practice.

Design Patterns were thought up in the mid-90s in a book titled "Design Patterns-Elements of Resusable Object-Orietned Software"
written by by a group of authors known as the "Gang of Four". 

The book was written using the Java and Smalltalk language. Since these were written before C# was a thing, we can use our
conversion skills to transfer from one language to another accordingly.

to identify them and when a pattern may be a good idea.
