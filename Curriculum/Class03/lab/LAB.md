# Lab 03

Work with your team and create a project! 

## Problem Domain
You have been tasked with making and persisting a list. You get to pick the topic! Think of different lists:

1. Grocery List
2. Tasks/To-Do
3. Cat Names

Get creative, think up you own!

## Problem Specifications

Your `Program.cs` file have the following functionality:

   1. Create a "user menu for different actions that asks the user to
          - Add an item to a list
          - Remove an item from the list
          - View the list
          - "Exit" the program
          - The user interface should re-appear after each action. 
   
2. Exception handling - log the errors into a log file as they come up. Make up custom errors as well! 

3. Write out to another file your individual list items. Allow CRUD operations 

## Unit Tests

1. Test for the ability to properly do CRUD operations to a text file. This may consist of you writing to a file locally in your test project and confirming that the method does as expected. Consider bringing in the path to each method. 

2. Test any non void methods that are not requesting user input

## README
**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** 
Here are the requirements for a valid readme:

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to

1. tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
1. show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
1. show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
1. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
