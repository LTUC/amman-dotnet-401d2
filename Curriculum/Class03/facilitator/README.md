# Class 03

## Learning Objectives
* The student will be introduced and implement the FileStream class
* The student will know how to Create, Read, Update, and Delete file using the FileStream
* The student will know how to properly open and close a file from an external location

## How do I prep for today?
Review the System.IO.md in the Resources Folder. This is a great outline to become familiar with System.IO and 
a good template to use when presenting the lecture. 

## Lecture
1. Code Review of TDD
   - Code out lab together possibly
1. System IO File Class
	- Lecture Notes [here]("./Resources/SystemIO.md")
1. Domain Modeling
   - Review what it is
   - What does it look like?
1. Lab Review
    - Expectations of lab
    - This is a challenging lab, extended due date to be right before classes 06. 

## Lab Notes

The lab for this day is intentionally challenging. This lab is designed to test the students on the planning of a project (domain modeling), and the application of everything they have learned in the language so far. They are not allowed to use classes in this lab, as we cover that in class 04.

The due date for this lab should be extended to right before class 06. Students traditionally need this time to finish up the assignment. 

This is a great lab to help them practice their debugging skills. Here are some tips:
1. Make sure they are using breakpoints within Visual Studio.
1. When asking a question, encourage students to avoid comments like "it doesn't work". Determine "what" doesn't work. Have them break
down the specific method, and code line that isn't giving them what they want. This is difficult for most students. 
1. When planning out their program, students can use this opportunity on "how" to approach the problem. What needs to 
created first, then how do you build out from there?

## What changed from yesterday? 
They are expected to test their code now moving forward.

## What might students struggle with today? 
- System IO is a pretty simple concept that most students get right away. File manipulation with the CRUD operations 
is pretty straight forward, especially when you break it down into 4 parts. 
The biggest challenge that they get is file location and accessing it. This can be different depending on the machine. I usually strongly 
encourage the students to have the file located on the root of their project. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
N/A

## General comments
- This is a great lecture to incorporate the exception handling to pull together everything from the past 2 days into the lecture
and show the students how everything works together. This is their first big project, and can be equivalent to a "test" and they really get a chance to practice the fundamentals before
moving into Classes and OOP on days 4 and 5.
