## How do I prep for today?
Review lecture notes, past youtube lecture videos. become familiar with System.IO

1. System IO File Class
	- Lecture Notes [here]("../Resources/SystemIO.md")

## What changed from yesterday? 
They are expected to test their code now moving forward

## What might students struggle with today? 
- System IO is a pretty simple concept that most students get right away. file manipulation with the CRUD operations 
is pretty straight forward. especially when you break it down into 4 parts. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- Studetns find this lab to be exceptionally difficult. I found that i have had to extend the deadline on the lab
because they get too hung upo n the overall problem domain. They usually have fun with the lab, but it is 
usually a challenge for them to put everything htye have learned thus far into one full application. 

## General comments
- This is a great lecture to incorporate the exception handling into. pull together evertything from the past 2 days into the lecture
and show the students how everything works together.
