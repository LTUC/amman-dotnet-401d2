# Class 03

## Learning Objectives
* The student will be introduced and implement the FileStream
* The student will know how to Create, Read, Update, and Delete file using the FileStream
* The student will know how to properly open and close a file from an external location

## How do I prep for today?
Review the System.IO.md in the Resources Folder. This is a great outline to become familiar with System.IO and 
a good template to use when presenting the lecture. 

1. System IO File Class
	- Lecture Notes [here]("../Resources/SystemIO.md")

## What changed from yesterday? 
They are expected to test their code now moving forward

## What might students struggle with today? 
- System IO is a pretty simple concept that most students get right away. file manipulation with the CRUD operations 
is pretty straight forward. especially when you break it down into 4 parts. 
The biggest challenge that they get is file location and accessing it. This can be different depending on the machine I usually strongly 
encourage the students to have the file located on the root of their project. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- Students find this lab to be exceptionally difficult. I found that i have had to extend the deadline on the lab
because they get too hung up on the overall problem domain. They usually have fun with the lab, but it is 
usually a challenge for them to put everything they have learned thus far into one full application. 

This is a great lab to help them practice their debugging skills. Here are some tips:
1. Make sure they are using breakpoints
1. When asking a question, they can't just say "it doesn't work". Determine "what" doesn't work. Have them break
down the specific method, and code line that isn't giving them what they want. This is difficult for most students. 
1. When planning out their program, students can use this opportunity on "how" to approach the problem. What needs to 
created first, then how do you build out from there?

## General comments
- This is a great lecture to incorporate the exception handling into. pull together everything from the past 2 days into the lecture
and show the students how everything works together. This is their first big project, and can be equivalent to a "test" and they really get a chance to practice the fundamentals before
moving into Classes and OOP on days 4 and 5.
