# Class 42: Ethics

## How do I prep for today?
Read through the articles in the reading. This is the basic
outline of the types of topics that you can discuss. 

_*The main goal of today is to bring awareness to the students of the 
types of issues they may encounter and the decisions they have to face in their career, not to tell them how to think*_


## Lecture

A fun video clip to introduce the topic to:
[The Trolly Problem - The Good Place (1:21 clip)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrPkcYQobro)

Have an open discussion with the class. Make sure that you preface the conversation with the class on being professional and respectful to those participating. Remind them that they are allowed to disagree with other students respecfully and professionally, but not attack other students or
belittle students for their opinions. In the workforce, regardless of the field, we are going to encounter those who hold different beliefs than us. We have to know how to still work professionally with those who do not share our same thoughts and still stay an open and collaborative environment. 

During the class discussion, use either the whiteboard, or some drawing tool to write down the accumulation of ideas and responses that you get from students. 
1. Morals vs Ethics
   - What are morals?
   - What are ethics?
   - How do they differ?

2. Why do we need Ethics?

3. From here...move the conversation to discuss the readings. Talk with the students about some of the stories of the 
readings and why we need to think about them from an ethical stand point? Are you able to get a disusccion going
that can highlight the talking points from both supporting and opposing sides? 

4. If you are unsure of what to do, or how to talk about it...consider focusing on how fast technology is moving. Discuss the problems it is solving, and what problems it is creating. Focus on how, as developers, it's really important for us to take these scenarios and questions into consideration as we move through our career.

## General comments
From feedback, students really enjoy this discussion because it talks about the consequences for the technology we are building and working with. It's really important for developers to stay educated and aware of these types of issues. I have not yet had any "issues" with this talk. It can be an intimidatig talk to give, but have found really professional and respectful behavior.
