to use existing data to forcast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

using machine learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed.

#### Determining If Your Data is ready
You will know that your data is ready to be used in Data Science if it meets the following criteria:
1. Relevant
2. Connected
3. Accurate
4. Enough to work with

## What is a Decision Tree?
Used in data science to represent decisions and decision making. 
Can be used in Data mining, but is laso used in machine learning. 

## What is a Linear Regression?
A linear regresssio is used when asking how much or how many? This will allow us
to determine, given a set of data, and evaluating historical data, how much or how many
is this thing. 


### Draw
