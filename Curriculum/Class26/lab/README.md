# Lab 26: Sprint 1 - Milestone #1

## Instructions:

We are going to start this project by scaffolding out a basic MVC application. Divide the following tasks out amoungst you and your partner(s) to ensure that you are ready for the remainder of the sprint:

1. One team member should make an [Azure Dev Ops](https://dev.azure.com){:target="_blank"} account. Invite the rest of your team, your assigned grader, and the instructor. 
1. Create a new repository
1. Create a new user story with the following story:
   - "As a user, I would like to be greeted by a welcoming message when first visiting the site".
1.  Create the following tasks associated with this user story:
    - Scaffold out an MVC website with default routing to `Home` controller and `Index` action
    - Add a `.gitignore`
    - Create Controllers and Views folder
    - Create a new `index.html` file in a `Home` folder inside `Views`
    - Create basic HTML greeting
1. Create a new branch off of that user story and complete the tasks
1. Once you have confirmed your code works locally and all tasks are done, push the code back up to Azure Repos on a new branch
1. Create a new Pull Request with a short message of completed work
1. Require one of your team members to review and merge the code into master.
8. Have one team member deploy your application to Azure.
