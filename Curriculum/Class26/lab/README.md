# Lab 26: Sprint 1 - Milestone #1

Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## Instructions:
Please read this document, in it's entirety, before beginning.

We are going to start this project by scaffolding out a basic MVC application. Divide the following tasks out amoungst you and your partner(s) to ensure that you are ready for the remainder of the sprint:

1. Have one of the team members create the Azure Dev Ops project and invite the others.
1. Follow the directions located under "Create a Repo" located in the [Azure DevOps Cheat Sheet](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/Curriculum/ECom_Project/AzureDevOps_CheatSheet){:target="_blank"}. 
1. When scaffolding out the basic MVC application complete the following tasks:
    - Scaffold out an MVC website with default routing to `Home` controller and `Index` action
    - Add a `.gitignore`
    - Create Controllers and Views folder
    - Create a new `index.html` file in a `Home` folder inside `Views`
    - Create basic HTML greeting
1. Once you have confirmed your code works locally and all tasks are done, push the code back up to Azure Repos.
1. Have one team member deploy your application to Azure.
