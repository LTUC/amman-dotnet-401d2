# Canvas

If you are choosing to use Canvas, here are the instructions on how to get Canvas
ready for the 2nd half project:

1. Change the home page of Canvas to the e-commerce landing page. The canvas landing home page usually consists of:
   - The intro to the project
   - A road map of each of the sprints and the assignments associated with them (only publish one sprint at a time)
   - Extra resources to have on hand during the course.  (example: Syllabus)
   - Partners for the project and the assigned "grader" for each group

**For grading purposes, you should have the same TA/Grader for each person in a group.** You
may need to re-allocate grading groups so that the same TA/Grader is grading BOTH partners
for their project. Grading for each Sprint is explained in the Sprint 1 submission instructions.

To enable the new default home page, follow these directions:
1. Go to to your current "Home" page.
2. select the "Choose Home Page" button on the top right hand corner
3. Select "Pages Front Page" and make sure that the "Build an E-Commerce Store" is selected
4. Select Save
5. You can easily edit this page by selecting "Edit" located in the top right corner of the page.
6. You will need to also confirm that each of the assignments posted on this homepage are properly mapping
to the correct assignments. 
   - To link the assignments, highlight the text (example: "Sprint 1"), and select the "Assignments" box on the 
   right hand side. Once you "select" the correct assignment, 
Canvas will link that to text to that assignment.
