# Class 26 Intro to Identity

## How do I prep for today?
Introduce Identity in Core. Review the readings for the day.
Scaffold out a templated MVC web app that has Individual User Account Authentication. 
View all the "new" components that Identity gives you....this includes the changes to the startup file and the new controllers for login/register. 

1. Get familiar with Azure Dev OPS (formally known as VSTS) project management tool. 
2. Have student pairs ready to be posted in the class. Each group should:
	- Create a Dev Ops account
	- Think up a product to sell
	- Scaffold out an MVC application with a SQL database
	- Deploy the basic app to Azure (only on one of the accounts)

## What changed from yesterday? 
New Topic. Just coming off of Project week. Students should be refreshed and ready to start the second half.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Documentation. It is not clear, and since we are working with .NET Core 2.0, the docs for identity have specifically changed since 1.1. There is a lot of documentation out there that 
is outdated. There are some great docs out there, and many of them are shared through-out these facilitators guide.

Really encourage the students to troubleshoot and use what knowledge and information they have about the framework to solve any problems/issues they have. This
may include piecing bits and pieces from external documentation to come up with a solid solution. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- Identity is not documented well.

## General comments
This is a multi-week project broken up into 3 sprints. This is focusing mostly on half process and half code. At the end of every week, they will have a sprint due. After 3 sprints, the project is completed.
