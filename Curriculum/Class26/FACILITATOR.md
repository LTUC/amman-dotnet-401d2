## How do I prep for today?
Introduce Identity in Core. Review the readings for the day.
Scaffold out a templated MVC web app that has Individual User Account Authentication. 
View all the "new" components that Identity gives you....this includes the changes to the startup file nad the new controllers for login/register. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
New Topic. Just coming off of Project week. Students should be refreshed and ready to start the second half.

## What might students struggle with today? 
Documentation. It is not clear, and since we are working with .NET Core 2.0, the docs for identity have specifically changed since 1.1. There is a lot of documentaion out there that

Really encourage the students to troubleshoot and use what knowledge and information they have about the framework to solve any problems/issues they have. This
may include piecing bits and pieces from external documentation to come up with a solid solution. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
