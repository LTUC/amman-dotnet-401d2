=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.


## Directions:

Each milestone will be worth 10 points within the sprint. The grading rubric is specified at the bottom.
 

## User Stories & Guidance:

Here are the user stories for Milestone 1:
1. (Developer 1 and 2 (and 3)) As a Developer, I would like to use Azure Dev Ops as my Project Management Tool so that I can organize
my tasks efficiently. 
2. (Developer 1 & 3) As a Developer, I want to build out the skeleton of an MVC site with a Home Controller
3. (Developer 2) As a Developer, I want to use SQL Server as my database
4. (Developer 1, 2, 3) As a Developer, I want to deploy both my database and web app to Azure


User Story 1 and 2 of this milestone is to get your project setup and ready.

1. One partner needs to create an Azure Dev Ops Account [Azure Dev Ops Account](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/). Invite your partner to the project. 
1. Create out an empty MVC site like we have been during week 3.
1. Create your HomeController with the appropriate view.
1. Add in UserSecrets into you your project
1. Don't forget your .gitignore!
1. Connect an SQL Server database into your application. No tables are required yet, but be ready to add tables as we progress through the project.
1. User story 4 means you want to deploy the app to Azure. Only one person, in each pair, needs to deploy.

## Tests

No tests are required for today. 


## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements descibed above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements descibed above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // methods and variables namings are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are propertly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
