=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.


## User Stories & Guidance:

Here are the user stories for Milestone 1:
1. (Developer 1 and 2 (and 3)) As a Developer, I would like to use Azure Dev Ops as my Project Management Tool so that I can organize my tasks efficiently. 
2. (Developer 1 & 3) As a Developer, I want to build out the skeleton of an MVC site with a Home Controller
3. (Developer 2) As a Developer, I want to use SQL Server as my database
4. (Developer 1, 2, 3) As a Developer, I want to deploy both my database and web app to Azure


User Story 1 and 2 of this milestone is to get your project setup and ready.

1. One partner needs to create an Azure Dev Ops Account [Azure Dev Ops Account](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/team-services/). Invite your partner to the project. 
1. Create out an empty MVC site like we have been during week 3.
1. Create your HomeController with the appropriate view.
1. Add in UserSecrets into you your project
1. Don't forget your .gitignore!
1. Connect an SQL Server database into your application. No tables are required yet, but be ready to add tables as we progress through the project.
