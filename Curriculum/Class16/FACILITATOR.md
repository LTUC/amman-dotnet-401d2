## What changed from yesterday? 
New topic!

## What might students struggle with today?  
A lot of students look at APIs as glorified external databases. It's important to make
sure that they understand that it is not that and that they are important to know when it 
comes to being a developer. 

They usually can't answer "what is an API" so try and make sure everyone has a good answer
if they are asked. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?

## General comments
The Lab for this day is a two part lab...Day 17 will be the second half of it. 
Get as far as you can, since it is a lot to cover in one day, and then finish up on day 17. 
It is ok to "not assign" the lab for day 16, and just assign it as a whole on 17 if you think
it would be helpful. 

This lab will take some time, so i usually make it due the sunday night before project week starts,
along with lab 18 that will consume the API they are creating.
