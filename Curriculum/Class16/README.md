# Class 16

## Learning Objectives
1. The student will learn about dependency injection and when to use it.
1. The still will learn and implement the repository architechural pattern within their code base to keep the web app loosly coupled. 


## Lecture Outline
1. Dependency Injection
   - Dependency Injection is extremely useful and important when loosly coupling dependencies within our code base. Dependency Injection allows us to work directly with the service provider and incorporate third parties without the fear of tighly coupling them into the web application. 
1. Repository Design Pattern
   - The repository architechural design pattern has slowly become more and more popular over the past few years. This pattern allows us to implement a layer of abstraction into our code base to not repeat basic operations such as CRUD to ensure we are meeting the basic functionlity needs. This pattern is showcased through interfaces and services.
