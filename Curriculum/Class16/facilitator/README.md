# Class 16: Dependency Injection

## How do I prep for today?

Build off of the demo code from class 14. 

Today's Topics:
1. Intro to Dependency Injection (powerpoint)
2. Intro to the Repository Design Pattern
	- Review of Interfaces
	- Create a new interface with basic CRUD operations
		- IStudent
		- ICourse
	- Create services that implement the interfaces
	- Register the Interface using DI
3. Intro to Testing MVC applications

## Lecture

- **Dependency Injection**
  - **Why** (5 min)
    - Keeping our applications "loosly coupled" is important because we want applications to depend on behavior and functionality instead of actual dependencies. 
  - **What** (10 min)
    - The ability to inject dependencies into our web application without being tightly coupled to a specific service or application. We work with the service provider directly to map what dependencies get injected into where. 
  - **How** (30 min)
    -  xxx
  - **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
    - 

Be prepared to review this concept again on class 17. This day's demo should have consisted of
Refactoring only 1 controller with a new interface and service. It is reccomended
that you also do a second controller with interface and service on Day 17 to solidify the concepts. 

Review Class 17 facilitator notes for guidance of the "review DI Day".


## What changed from yesterday? 
Building off of class 14 to continue the student enrollment

## What might students struggle with today?  
This is a very heavy day. We are introducing two new major concepts
that blend into together. 

Students will likely not get these concepts right away.  Historically,
they understand these concepts after exposure, repitition, and constant explanation. 
don't be suprised if you find yourself repeating the same thing over and over again. Eventually
they will get it!
