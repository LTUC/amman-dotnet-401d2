## Overview

## Learning Objectives
Review student facing readme.

## How do I prep for today?
- The Readme.md for this directory is what should be student facing in the class repo.
- Look in the resources folder to find the topics that should be covered in this lecture The topics that should be covered are:

Before Class:
1. If you are an afternoon lecture time, give the students the [Calculator Assignment](Calculator.md) before class. This assignment should be graded based off of if a healthy attempt was made. It should only take them 2-3 hours to complete. 
2. If you are not in an afternoon lecture time, you may optionally give this assignment to students as you see fit.

Lecture Outline:

1. Introduction to C# and ASP.NET (30 min)

	- Types Lecture located [here]("../Resources/Types.md")
3. Exception Handling (90 min) 
	- Lecture outline [here]("../Resources/ExceptionHandling.md")
	- DemoCode [here](../../DemoCode/ExceptionExample)
4. Debugging (30 min)
	- Debug the DemoCode to show how it works
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
- N/A

## What might students struggle with today
- students often pick up `Try/Catch/Finally` pretty quickly. Often they have a hard time understanding `throw` statements.
- This may also be the student's first exposure to a statically typed language, so be prepared for some questions regarding the differences
between JavaScript and C# (or any OOP language).

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
This can be a long day, there is a lot to cover to get them rolling and most of this content is brand new. 

## General comments
Since this is the first day, There isn't really much to review. <br />
The expectation is that they have all completed the pre-work, so you shouldn't spend much time on the 
basics of the language (iterative/selective statements, asking/receiving user input). They can ask questions
but focus mostly on the content for the day's lecture...the prework practice should come out as you do your demos.
