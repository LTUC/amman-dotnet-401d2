# Class 01:

Intro to C# and Exception Handling

## Overview

## Learning Objectives
Review student facing readme.

## How do I prep for today?

1. The Readme.md for this directory is what should be student facing in the class repo.
1. If you are an afternoon lecture time, give the students the [Calculator Assignment](../Calculator.md) before class. This assignment should be graded based off of if a healthy attempt was made. It should only take them 2-3 hours to complete. If you are not in an afternoon lecture time, you may optionally give this assignment to students as you see fit.

## What changed from yesterday? 
- N/A

## What might students struggle with today
- students often pick up `Try/Catch/Finally` pretty quickly. Often they have a hard time understanding `throw` statements.
- This may also be the student's first exposure to a statically typed language, so be prepared for some questions regarding the differences
between JavaScript and C# (or any OOP language).

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
This can be a long day, there is a lot to cover to get them rolling and most of this content is brand new. 

## General comments
Since this is the first day, There isn't really much to review. <br />
The expectation is that they have all completed the pre-work, so you shouldn't spend much time on the 
basics of the language (iterative/selective statements, asking/receiving user input). They can ask questions
but focus mostly on the content for the day's lecture...the prework practice should come out as you do your demos.
