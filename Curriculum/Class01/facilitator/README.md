# Class 01:

Intro to C# and Exception Handling

## Overview 
* First day of Class! Spend the first part of class doing kickoff with the students
* Spend no more than 30 minutes with students reviewing the pre-work. Do a review about what they should have learned and applied to their lab that they were instructed to create. 
 
## Learning Objectives
Review student facing readme.

## How do I prep for today?

1. The Readme.md for this directory is what should be student facing in the class repository.
1. If you are an afternoon lecture time, give the students the [Calculator Assignment](../lab/Calculator.md){:target="_blank"}  before class. This assignment should be graded based off if a healthy attempt was made by the student. It should only take them 2-3 hours to complete. If you are not in an afternoon lecture time, you may optionally give this assignment to students as you see fit.
1. Become familar with the lecture topics and demo code.
1. Complete the daily readings and be prepared if students have questions.
1. Be prepared to answer questions about the prework.

## Lab Notes
1. The `Calculator` should only be given if you need some time before the first day of class. This lab is optional.
1. The directions for the lab today are very specific. Make sure the students thoroughly read the directions. 
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
- N/A

## What might students struggle with today
- Students often pick up `Try/Catch/Finally` pretty quickly. Often they have a hard time understanding `throw` statements.
- This may also be the student's first exposure to a statically typed language, so be prepared for some questions regarding the differences
between JavaScript and C# (or any OOP language).

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
This can be a long day, there is a lot to cover to get them rolling and most of this content is brand new. 

## General comments
Since this is the first day, there isn't really much to review. <br />
The expectation is that they have all completed the pre-work, so you shouldn't spend much time on the 
basics of the language (iterative/selective statements, asking/receiving user input). They can ask questions
but focus mostly on the content for the day's lecture... the prework practice should come out as you do your demos.
