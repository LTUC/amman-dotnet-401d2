=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment

- fork this repository
- create a new branch named `lab01-`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab01-amanda`
- write your code
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas
- Include a Readme.md (contents described below)

## Directions
- Create an "About Me" quiz that has at least 5 different questions. 
- Each question should be something fun, unique, or interesting about yourself

## Program Specifications
- Your solution should include the following:
    - Main method
	- external methods- (at least 3 non-void return types)
		- Have different return types!
	- Exception Handling (try/catch/finally)
	- Are you able to incorprate a `throw` somehow? 
	
Stay within scope of this project. Please only use concepts and resources that we have covered so far in previous labs/lectures/assigned prework. 
If you are unsure if it is within scope, please ask a TA or instructor.


### Stretch

- Track number of correct/incorrect questions 
      - Show the user the number of correct/incorrect to user after quiz is over

## ReadMe

Provide setup documentation 

- **Comment your code.**
- Provide a readme that includes clear directions on setting up this program.
- Questions to Consider: 
	1. What programs do I need installed?
	1. What are the step by step directions?
	1. How do I run the program?
	1. How do I know the program worked successfully?

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	5       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	4       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements descibed above // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	3       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements descibed above // Program runs/compiles |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 4/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // methods and variables namings are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are propertly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
