# Class 01

## Overview 
* First day of Class! Spend the first part of class doing kickoff with the students
* Spend no more than an hour with students reviewing the pre-work. Do a review about what they should have learned and applied to their lab 
that they were instructed to create. 
 
## Learning Objectives
* The student will successfully request user input and output a response to the console.
* The student will implement try-catch statements as a form of exception handling within their code.
* Set-up a debugger within Visual Studio 2017
* Understand and be comfortable with debugging through code to identify potential bugs and errors. 

## How do I prep for today?
- Look in the resources folder to find the topics that should be covered in this lecture The topics that should be covered are:

1. Introduction to C# and ASP.NET (30 min)
2. Different types in the langauge (Types.md in Resources)(30 min)
3. Exception Handling (90 min) (DemoCode) (Exceptionhandling.md in Resources)
4. Debugging (30 min) (Debug the DemoCode to show it's uses)
 
## What changed from yesterday? 
- N/A

## What might students struggle with today
- students often pick up `Try/Catch/Finally` pretty quickly. Often they have a hard time understanding `throw` statements.
- This may also be the student's first exposure to a statically typed langauge

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
None to note

## General comments
Since this is the first day, There isn't really much to review. <br />
The expectation is that they have all completed the pre-work, so you shouldn't spend much time on the 
basics of the language (iterative/selective statements, asking/receiving user input). They can ask questions
but focus mostly on the content for the day's lecture...the prework practice should come out as you do your demos.
