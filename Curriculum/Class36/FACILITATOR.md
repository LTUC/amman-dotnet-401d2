# Class 36 : 3rd Party Technical Documenation

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about reading and utulizing technical documentation
from a 3rd party. 

We will be using Authorize.NET as a 3rd party service. The point
of today is to practice reading and utilizing 3rd party docs
and directly reading them into your code. 

This is a great practice to get curious and add some functionality 
to their existing ecommerce site.

## What changed from yesterday? 
Beginning of Sprint 3! They should have just finished sprint 2 and 
are ready to start adding final functionality over the next few days to their site. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
Reading documentation is not easy. Students get overwhelmed 
and flustered with the amount of content. We have to teach them
how to take it bit by bit and help guide them how to pull from 
the documentaion what is useful and what is needed. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Sometimes Auth.NET doens't play nice with some versions of core.
It is proven to be successful with both 2.0 and 2.1..even though we get
a dependency warning. 

In addition to installing the Auth.NET NuGet Package, the student will also need to install the 
Configuration Manager package. This is required for the Auth Net Library

## General comments
This is a fun integration to add to the lab. It's a lot though.
Encourage curiousity and try to encourage students to look on their own and
see what they can learn. This may be the first time we tell them "read the docs"
and mean it in a way to challenge them. (the lecture outline does contain a lot of
guidance on this particular service, so they can always crutch back on lecture
for how to use this service.)
