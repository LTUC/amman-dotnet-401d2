# Razor Pages

## What
Razor Pages is what Microsoft is pushing as the 
new "default" web application template. Meaning
they are making most sites to utulize razor page. 

## Why

Page models make manangement of data much easier. 
Sometimes MVC can overcomplicate the process,
and razor pages allows us to remove the controller
and just use the page model to handle the data transfromation.

## How

Razor Pages sits on top of MVC. This means you can have the two
work together in the same app. It is is still mvc, jsut without the controller.

Think of Razor Pages of more of an MVVM approach. This will allow us to
not worry about the controller at all and just work with data as is. 

## Demo

1. Go over the template that Microsoft provides
and view how a Razor page looks and feels. 

2. Pull up demo code and create your own razor page in class.
Since the assignment for the daily milestone ins to get user information,
this may be a good thing to demo in class.

If you want to be more abstract, create a razor page that displays
a list of articles or all the information about an article. 

Essentially, a razor page can replace a very simple controller easily.
