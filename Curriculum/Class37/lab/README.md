# Lab : Sprint 3 Milestone 2

Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## User Stories & Guidance:

1. (Developer 1 & 2 & 3) As an administrator, I would like to view all of the orders that have been placed on my site. 

### Guidance

**User Story 1**:Â Wrap up your admin panel by adding a section where the administrator can grab all of the orders from the database and showcase them on the admin site. Show the Order Number, Name of customer, total cost.

	As a stretch, add the ability to "click" on the order and be redirected to an order details page.
