# Class 12: Relational Database and ERDs

## How do I prep for today?

Adjust the lab assignment for this day. It is a timed assignment. 
Make it open at the very beginning of lab time, and due 5 hours later. Closed
and due date should be the same. 

You will review the solution to the lab right away at the beginning of class 13.

## How do I prep for today?
1. If you are unfamiliar with Databases and their relationships, a good place to start is [Here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/index.htm)
1. Review the MSFT docs for complex data models [HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/complex-data-model?view=aspnetcore-2.0){:target="_blank"} 
    - Start from the Overview and work your way through the whole tutorial if you can. 
4. Review what an ERD is. The "Databases.md" located in the resources folder is an outline of the lecture for that day. 
2. I recommend also reviewing the microsoft docs of the "complex" data model. This doc provides a good background of what the ERD should consist of. 

## Lecture

1. Code Review
   - Review the MVC lab. 
   - Show the students the solution to reading in a csv file and converting it to an object
   - Review Turnery operators
2. Review data persistance
   - What is data persistance? 
   - What are databases? Why do we need them?
3. Introduce ERDs

## Lab Notes

This lab is timed and is attempt based. They should be able to read through the problem domain and come up with an ERD for the database as well as provide an explanation. You will provide and review the solution with them at the start of the next class.

## What changed from yesterday? 
No code is written today. Just reviewing diagrams.

## What might students struggle with today?  
Nothing major. Overall ERDs are straight forward to break down.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Database key relationships for composite keys are brand new. foreign and primary keys are review. 

## General comments
Spend the last hour of lecture time having the students attempt
to make an ERD based off of the problem domain (located in the bottom of the `Database.md` file)

Spend a few minutes  reviewing the requirement. Have the students group off
and attempt the erd (20 min or so) and spend the last 15 having the students present their
ideas and reviewing the solution. 

Be sure to share this solution with the students, as that is what our demo for the next
few days will be tied too.
