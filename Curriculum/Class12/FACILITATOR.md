# Class 12: Relational Database and ERDs

## How do I prep for today?
1. If you are unfamiliar with Databases and their relationships, a good place to start is [Here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/index.htm)
1. Review the MSFT docs for complex data models [HERE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/complex-data-model?view=aspnetcore-2.0){:target="_blank"} 
    - Start from the Overview and work your way through the whole tutorial if you can. 
4. Review what an ERD is. The "Databases.md" located in the resources folder is an outline of the lecture for that day. 
2. I recommend also reviewing the microsoft docs of the "complex" data model. This doc provides a good background of what the ERD should consist of. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
No code is written today. Just reviewing diagrams.

## What might students struggle with today?  
Nothing major. Overall ERDs are straight forward to break down.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Database key relationships for composite keys are brand new. foreign and primary keys are review.
