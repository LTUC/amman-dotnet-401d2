# Class 12: Relational Database and ERDs

## How do I prep for today?
1. Review what an ERD is. The "Databases.md" located in the resources folder is an outline of the lecture for that day. 
2. I recommend also reviewing the microsoft docs of the "complex" data model. This doc provides a good background of what the ERD should consist of. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
No code is written today. Just reviewing diagrams.

## What might students struggle with today?  
Nothing major. Overall ERDs are straight forward to break down.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Database key relationships for composite keys are brand new. foreign and primary keys are review.
