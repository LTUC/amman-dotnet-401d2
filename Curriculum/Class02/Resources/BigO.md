Time Efficiency is analyzed by determinng the number of repitions of the basic operatation as a function of 
input size

Basic Operation - the operation that contributes most towards running time of the algorithm


Basic operations:

comparison
multiply 
divide 


Plan for analysis:
1. Decide on a parmater for input size
2. Identify the basic operation
3. Worst, Averge, best case for input size n
4. Set up a sum for the number of time the basic operation is exiectued
5. Simplify the sum using standard formulas. (Summations)
