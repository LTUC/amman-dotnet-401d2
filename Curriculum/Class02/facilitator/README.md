# Class 02 Unit Testing

## Overview
* Today is solely focusing on how students should be approaching the setup and presentation of their assignments. 
* Use XUnit when unit testing within C#. 
* The documentation portion shows an example of what the readme documentation should look like, as well as comments within code.

## Learning Objectives
See student facing readme.


## How do I prep for today?
1.  Review what the most current XUnit version. Make sure it is compatible with your framework. 
2. Review the demo code and lecture doc

## Lecture
 1. Code Review on "About Me Quiz" / Code Challenge
 2. Introduction to TDD and Unit Testing
	- Lecture Notes [here]("../Resources/UnitTests.md")
 3. Demo
    - Recreate FizzBuzz using the TDD Red/Green/Refactor approach

## What changed from yesterday? 
- They should be comfortable with the language at this point at a beginner's level. Today we introduce Testing, the expectation moving 
forward is that they implement testing into their code everyday.

## What might students struggle with today? 
- Students may struggle with the concept of Test Driven Development.
- Many of the students don't fully know how to break down problems from a large abstract problem domain to smaller components
- You will find yourself encouraging students to "think simpler", eventually after a few tries, they get the hang of it.
