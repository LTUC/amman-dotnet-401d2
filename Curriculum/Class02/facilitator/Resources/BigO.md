Best: O Mega
Worst: Big O
Average: O Theta

Time Efficiency is analyzed by determining the number of repetitions of the basic operation as a function of input size

Basic Operation - the operation that contributes most towards running time of the algorithm


Basic operations:

comparison
multiply 
divide 
Addition


Plan for analysis:
1. Decide on a parameter for input size
1. Identify the basic operation
1. Worst, average, best case for input size n
1. Set up a sum for the number of time the basic operation is executed
1. Simplify the sum using standard formulas. (Summations)
