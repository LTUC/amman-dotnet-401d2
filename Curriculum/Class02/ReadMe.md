# Class 02: Unit Testing

## Learning Objectives
1. Students will be able to successfully create unit tests for their C# console applications using the Red/Green/Refactor approach. 
1. The students will understand and implement code coverage within their programs when testing.
1. Students will include intuitive comments within their code.
1. Students will setup readme documentation for each assignment given a specific format.

## Lecture Outline

### Unit Testing
- Test Driven Development
- Red/Green/Refactor
- Facts
	- Always true
- Theories
	- Conditionally True
- Why is it important?
	- Confidently refactor, make it agile
	- High Quality Code
	- Documentation
	- Assists in Debugging
	- Reduce company cost

### Demo
- Build/add a testing solution
	- Add a new project
	- Don't forget to add the reference
- Build out app with TDD
	- Test First, Code Last. Follow the R/G/R approach
- Show code coverage
	- How much of our code has been tested? Can we aim for 90%? 
	- What are the benefits of code coverage?

### Documentation
- Why do we need it
- Readme's <-- What are they?
- Proper Structure

### Example Readme
- [Sample Readme]("/sample-README.md")
