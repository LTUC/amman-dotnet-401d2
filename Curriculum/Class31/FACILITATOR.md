## How do I prep for today?
This is the start of Sprint #2. 

Remind the students of a few things:
1. Make a new "sprint" in Azure Dev Ops
2. Monday Reflections
3. Sprint 1 closes 48 hours after it's due. 
   - The longer you wait to submit, the longer you wait to get a grade. 

Lecture Outline:
1. Review the Identity process
2. Review View Models
3. View Components
