# Lab 31: Sprint 2 - Milestone # 1

Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## User Stories & Guidance:

Here are the user stories for Milestone 1:

1. (Developer 1 & 2) As a user, I would like to receive a notification after i register for an account on the site

1. (Developer 1 & 2) As a user, I would like to view specific product details


### Guidance

**User story 1:** Using the SendGrid tutorial, integrate it into your application so that after registration an email gets sent to the user. Use the repository design pattern.

**User story 2:** On the browse page that shows all of the products, allow the user to click on a specific product and be redirected to an individual page with the product details. Show all the required information to the user for them to make an informed decision about the product. Use Razor Pages for this task. Don't add an "add to basket" button just yet. we will do that soon.
