# Class 31

## How do I prep for today?
This is the start of Sprint #2. 

Remind the students of a few things:
1. Make a new "sprint" in Azure Dev Ops
1. Sprint 1 closes 48 hours after it's due. 
   - The longer you wait to submit, the longer you wait to get a grade. 
1. Peer Reviews!


You can start the demo for today by extending the Demo from class 29. Don't forget to setup 
user secrets!

Lecture Outline:
1. Review Sprint 1
