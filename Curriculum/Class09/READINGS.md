## Submission Requirements

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and create a wiki entry in your fork of the class repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a Code 301-level student interested in learning about it.

Journal entry ideas:
* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
