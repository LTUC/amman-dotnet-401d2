1. Obtain a general understanding of design patterns and why they are important. 

### Lecture
1. Code Review
2. Review the "Recursion" document located in the resources folder 
3. You may optionally choose to teach the design patterns lecture this day in addition to recursion. The Design Pattern lecture is located in the "Extra_Lectures" folder. The reading for the day still introduces design patterns, you may choose how it is introduced and discussed in the class.

## What changed from yesterday? 
N/A

## What might students struggle with today?  
1. Concept of Design patterns is new. Introduce it so they understand where these solutions came from.
2. Historically, recursion is not something that is easily grasped. I recommend showing the callstack through each of the examples, draw it out and each stack frame if you can. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
N/A

## General comments
No Lab on this day. Just teach the Design Pattern Concept and show what the Factory design pattern is.
