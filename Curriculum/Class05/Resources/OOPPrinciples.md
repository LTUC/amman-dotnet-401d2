# Object Oriented Programming Principles

## Procedural Programming vs OOP Programming

### Procedural Programming (imperative programming)
Procedural programming is a list of instructions that tells program what to do step by step.
Procedural relies on a series of computational steps to be carried to completion. This is usualy done telling 
the program what to do first at the beginning, and what to do at the end. it is a bit more intuitive and simple
to read from top to bottom. Procedural programming languages are also called "top down "


### What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object oriented programming is mimicking real world objects in code. 
Everything in C# is essentaily a class, and we can instantiate objects from 
classes that we can manage at a smaller level. 

OOP objects are created to interact with other elements of the program regardless of where the command
is being called from. 

## Inheritance

## Abstraction
