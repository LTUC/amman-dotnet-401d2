## The Problem Domain
Think about a vehicle dealership. They sell vehichles of all sorts, Cars, Trucks, Boats, heck..they could even sell airplanes! Think about what each of these vehichles have in common.  
Build out the hierarchy of a vehicle dealership. Your program will instantiate each of your concrete classes, and prove that they are inheriting traits/features from their various parent classes.

- This is part 1 of a 2 part assignment. 
- Using all 4 of the Object Oriented Principles (OOPs): 
		- Build out the hierarchical class structure of the animals within a zoo within Visual Studio and a digital diagram.
		- There should be at least 3 layers of inheritance with at least 5 different types of animals.                                                                                              
	- Prove that the OOP principles are being used by returning strings as necessary to prove that a 
	methods were property implemented or inherited.
		- Examples include: `Eat()` `Sleep()` `Sound()` etc... 
		- You are allowed to use these example methods, along with others not listed
	- Include the following labels:
		1. Label the parent and derived classes
		2. Label the abstract classes and concrete classes
		3. Label the access modifiers for each of the classes
		4. Label where you are using Polymorphism in your program. Where are the virtual and abstract methods defined, and where are they being overridden?
- Your program class should instantiate each of the concrete animals to prove the functionality of it's base classes. 


## Program Specifications
Your solution should include the following:
	- Have at least 3 different abstract classes
	- Have at least 3 layers of inheritance
	- Have at least 5 concrete animals
	- Have at least 2 abstract methods (make sure you override them)
	- Have at least 2 abstract Properties (make sure you override them)
	- Have at least 2 virtual methods (make sure you override at least one of them)
	- Have at least 2 virtual properties (make sure you override at least one of them)

	- Your (digital) drawing of your zoo diagram should be clearly labeled
<br />
*NOTE*: You are not required to be scientifically correct with your animal names. You will not be fact checked.
You do not need to label your animals anything more complicated than (Mammal, Reptile, Cat, Bird, etc....)


## Unit Tests
Test that your program has the following functionality: 
1. Test that each of your concrete animals exhibit the at least 2 appropriate behaviors given to them from a base class.


## Stretch Goals


## Additional Resources
- Please refer to the in-class diagram and code base as an example of the expectation. 


## README
**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** <br />
Here are the requirements for a valid readme: <br />

Your readme is ***extremely important*** in this lab because it will be a guide for us to know 
exactly what you did where and how. Define for me, in your readme, the following:
1. An introduction to the project
1. Your digital drawing of your zoo
1. Create your own technical documentation. Breakdown and define each of the OOP principles in your own words.
1. Provide under each OOP definition a couple (you do not have to define all) of examples of how you 
are applying this into your project
