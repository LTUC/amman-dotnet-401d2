# Class 05

## How do I prep for today?
1. Upload the demo code to the class repo. This will serve as an example for the students on what is expected for their lab.
1. Be prepared to go over the required data structure this day. Refer to the Common Curriculum Day 5 implementation on what data structure to teach.
1. There is an alternative lab that you may optionally choose. The initial lab is creating a zoo, the alternative lab is creating a vehicle dealership. Both have the same requirements, jsut different problem domains.

## Lecture
1. Code Review
1. Introduce OOP
     - Inheritance 
     - Abstraction
     - Polymorphism
     - Encapsulation

Included in the DemoCode folder is an example of a diagram that you can draw with the class as you 
go over the OOP principles. There is also the code base when converting the diagram to Visual Studio. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
N/A

## What might students struggle with today? 
- The actual reasoning and implementation behind the OOP principles usually go pretty smoothly. I have found 
breaking it down by each principle and showing how it looks in both the diagram and the VS code helps concrete the idea/concept.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- n/a

## General comments
This is a pretty fun day, and a great opportunity for the students to engage. I usually encourage class participation during this day as we "build out" our parties.
