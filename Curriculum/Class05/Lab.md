=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- create a new branch named `lab05-`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab05-amanda`
- write your code
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas
- Include a Readme.md (contents described below)

## Directions

- Using all 4 of the Object Oriented Principles (OOPs): 
		- Build out the hierarchical class structure of a zoo within Visual Studio and a digital diagram. 
		- There should be at least 3 layers of inheritance with at least 6 different types of animals. 
	- Prove that the OOP principles are being used by returning strings as neccesary to prove that a methods were propertly implemented or inherited.
		- Examples include: `Eat()` `Sleep()` `Sound()` etc... 
		- You are allowed to use these example methods, along with others not listed
	- Be sure to include a diagram with your solution of how your zoo is mapped out. 
	- Include the following labels:
		1. Label the parent and derived classes
		2. Label the abstract classes and concrete classes
		3. Label the access modifiers for each of the classes
		4. Label where you are using Polymorphism in your program. Where are the virtual and abstract methods defined, and where are they being overridden?


## Components
- Have at least 3 different abstract classes
- Have at least 3 layers of inheritance
- Have at least 4 abstract methods (make sure you override them)
- Have at least 4 virtual methods (make sure you override them)

- Your (digital) drawing of your zoo diagram should be clearly labeled of which classes

Your readme is extremely important in this lab because it will be a guide for us to know exactly what you did where and how. Define for me, in your readme, the
definitions of each of the OOP principles (in your own words), and provide a **couple** examples (you do not have to write all occurances out) where you are practing each of the OOP principles. 
Your program class should instantiate each of the concrete animals to prove that the functionality for each of the animals is as desired. 

## Example
Please refer to the included diagram and code base as an example of the expectiation. 


## ReadMe
A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to
1. tell them what it is (with context)
1. Show where each of the OOP principles are being used
2. show them what it looks like in action
3. show them how they use it
4. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. 
Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo for an example.

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	7       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution // Documenation and OOP implemenation exactly as required |
	5       | Program runs/compiles, Some implementation errors with OOP principles // Diagram shows some implementation errors|
	4       | Program runs/compiles // Digital Diagram missing approx. half of the required labels // Improper use of OOP principles |
	2       | Missing tests // tests are not passing // not enough valid tests |
	2       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors. |
	0       | No Submission |

- 3pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	3       | Code meets Industry Standards // methods and variables namings are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are propertly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented |
	2       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments |
	1       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
