## Lecture

1. **Identity**
    - **Why** (5 minutes)
        - Identity is used primarily for user management. This includes the security and manipulation of users within the application. Within Identity, we can restrict access to specific parts of the site through policies, assign specific roles to users, and allow for 3rd party authenticaion using OAUTH. 
  - **What** (10 minutes)
        - Identity is the ability to add Authentication and Authorization to your web application. This includes registrations, logins, restricted access to specific members, and authentication through Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc...
        ASP.NET Core Identity was created to help with the security and management of users. It provides this abstraction layer between the application and the users/role data. We can use the API in it's entirety, or just bits and pieces as we need (such as the salting/hashing by itself) or email services. There is a lot of flexibility within ASP.NET Core Identity. We have the ability to take or leave whatever we want. Identity combines well with EFCore and SQL Server. 
  - **How** (30 minutes)
        - See Identity.md doc
