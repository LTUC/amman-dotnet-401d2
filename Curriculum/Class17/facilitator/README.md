# Class 17

## How do I prep for today?

Today's Topics:
1. Review: Interfaces and Dependency Injection
2. HTML/CSS assistance
3. Testing assistance
4. Search & Filter results (Tutorial in reading)

## Lecture
1. Code Review
   - Expect to walk through the creation of a 2nd service and interface. Inject that interface into the controller and refactor the controller to use the interface instead of the DbContext.
   - show what the "join table controllers" look like. They will be injecting more than one interface into that controller. Show them how to use both to get different pieces of data from different injected data. 

2. Testing
   - Create an Xunit Test project 
   - Write tests against their interface to test the CRUD operations
   - Remind them about getter and setter tests
3. Review the Search/Filter tutorial
   - Emphasize the importance of View Models and why we like them. 


## What changed from yesterday? 
You will spend a majority of this day reviewing what yesterday's content was. The trick to assisting in the understanding of DI and the Repo design pattern is to keep repeating what is happening and drawing the demo image. Keep reviewing the code and going through the data flow (listed in the PPT). The more you walk through bit by bit the better it will be for the students to make the connections. 

Use lots of visuals. Show physical code. Navigate around the code base with them so they know no "magic" is actually happening. 


## What might students struggle with today?  
They are just trying to understand DI and the Repo Design Pattern. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?

## General comments
The students have until the night before project week starts to complete this assignment. They have some time to complete their tasks and add some css to the pages to make it look professional.
