# Class 08

## How do I prep for today?
1. Review the readings for the day. Be prepared to answer questions if the students have questions
1. Review the topics in the Resources folder
1. Review the demo code. Be comfortable with rebuilding it in class with the students.

## Lecture
1. Introduce Delegates
1. Introduce LINQ
1. Show LINQ Queries and LINQ Method calls
1. Talk about Anonymous Delegate Types (Func and Actions)

## What changed from yesterday? 
Building off of collections from yesterday. We will/can use `IEnumerable<T>` today for our result of our queries. May not hurt to re-review.

## What might students struggle with today?  
Delegates. It can be a lot. Delegates make more sense when we start using LINQ method calls. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
N/a

## General comments
Delegates really jump our complexity level. Student will understand what they are for right away...
