# Class 07

## Overview
Today, the students will build off of interfaces and see how a built in interface can apply to generic collections. They will see the use of enums and how they are used in code, and create their own generic collection and learn what actually happens when they get instantiated.

## How do I prep for today?
1. Read through the daily readings
1. Review the Resources folder with the Collections.md file
1. Get Familiar with IEnumerable and IEnumerator. Be able to explain the difference between them
1. Introduce Enums

## Lecture
1. Code Review
1. [Enums](./Resources/Enums)
1. [Collections](./Resources/Collections) (Generic vs Non-Generic)
