# Class 44: OSS Contribution

## Overview
This is a full project day for the students. Spend 30 minutes or so
with the students at the beginning of the day to review what the expectations are
for the day. The lab assignment is pretty straight forward, but show them
examples of open source projects and what types of tags they should be looking for
(example: first-timer). 

Ideally, they should have a PR by the end of the day, but if they don't, that's ok. 
They should have a good RCA doc that they created that reviews the issue
they chose and what is going on in the code. 

## How do I prep for today?
No prep required for today. The students can pair up, 
they should spend at least 4 hours on this project. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
Nothing. All Day project.

## What might students struggle with today?  
Finding an issue they feel comfortable contributing too. GH and Stack Overflow
can be intimidating. Work with and encourage students to "dive in" and they
will be suprised with the results :) 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Mostly just finding projects to contribute too. 

## General comments
This is a self-guided day. Students should be collaborating with each other. Work with
them if they encounter obsticles, but they should be really diving into the content
on their own.
