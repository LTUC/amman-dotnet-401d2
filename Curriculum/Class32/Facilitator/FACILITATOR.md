# Class 32 : View Components

## How do I prep for today?


## Lecture Outline:
1. Code Review
    - Review the data structure for the day
    - Do some data structure practice in class!
1. [View Components](./viewComponents.md)
   - What:
     - View Componenets are often referred to as "mini controllers" that can be inserted/injected into an cshtml page. This means that we can use these "mini controllers" to access data and manipulate objects as needed. 
   - Why: 
     - Reusability of specific components to be inserted on cshtml pages is fairly common. This can be something as simple as a login screen, or interactive such as a mini cart within an e-commerce project. 
   - How:
     - View Components are created by creating individual components often located in a "Components" folder within the models. These compents then act as mini controllers where you can access and return specific data from models. To insert a specific component into a page, call the component direclty onto the .cshtml page. 
    - Review the demo code for implementation details
