# Lab 32: Sprint 2 - Milestone #2

Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## User Stories & Guidance:

Here are the user stories for Milestone 1:

1. (Developer 1 & 2) As a user, I would like to receive an email notification after I register for an account on the site

1. (Developer 1 & 2) As a user, I would like an email sent to me at checkout with a summary of all the items that i've purchased.


### Guidance

**User story 1:** Using the SendGrid tutorial, integrate it into your application so that after registration an email gets sent to the user. Use the repository design pattern.

**User story 2:** On the checkout page, When the user selects the "Checkout" button, have that trigger an email to be sent to the user with a summary of their products. Redirect the page to a summary page of the items ordered as well.
