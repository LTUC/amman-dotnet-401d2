=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.


## Directions:

Each milestone will be worth 10 points within the sprint. The grading rubric is specified at the bottom.
 

## User Stories & Guidance:

Here are the user stories for Milestone 2:
1. (Developer 1) As a user, I would like to have a designated basket page that will allow me to modify the items in my basket
2. (Developer 2) As a user, I would like to quickly navigate to my basket from the home page. 


### Guidance

**User Story 1:** This is a place that will eventually "kickoff" your checkout process. Besides seeing all the basket items through the view component from yesterday, you should also be able to view all the items the user has on a dedicated page. Make it so that the basket items can be modified (View the product landing page of that product, edit the product qty, delete the product from the basket). 
	
**User Story 2:**  On the home page, the user should be able to see a shortcut for their basket. When they select this button, redirect the user to their appropriate basket. Make this page an [Authorize] page. They must be logged in to view their basket.
