# Goals and Reflections
Goals and reflections will take place every Monday/Wednesday/Friday

The point of these goals/reflections is to work with your partner
and 'recap' what you completed the past couple days and set goals for what 
you are hoping to achieve by the next goal/reflection day

### Reflections 

Each reflection should contain:

1. What was implemented (reference at least 2 different user stories you completed)
1. What blockers did you encounter?
1. How was the issue solved. 
1. What was your estimated time on the user story
1. What was the actual time on each user story
	- If your actual was under - what do you think helped
	- If your actual was over - why?


These reflections are done individually.
