# Goals and Reflections
Goals and reflections will take place every Monday/Wednesday/Friday

The point of these goals/reflections is to work with your partner
and 'recap' what you completed the past couple days and set goals for what 
you are hoping to achieve by the next goal/reflection day

Post both a goal and a reflection for today.

## Goals 
Each Goal should contain in a discussion post:
1. What user stories are going to be completed
1. What is your ETA on each of your user stories.
1. What user stories are you behind on that you need to catch up?

These goals are done individually.

### Reflections 

Each reflection should contain:

1. What was implemented (reference at least 2 different user stories you completed)
2. What blockers did you encounter?
3. How was the issue solved. 
4. What was your estimated time on the user story
5. What was the actual time on each user story
	- If your actual was under - what do you think helped
	- If your actual was over - why?


These reflections are done individually.
