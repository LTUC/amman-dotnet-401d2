# Sprint 2 Requirements

These are the expectations for Sprint 2.

Identify, beween your partner and yourself, who is Developer 1, and who is Developer 2. 
The appropriate developer will complete the stories assigned to him/her as noted next to each user story. 

As a team, you will submit the following into Canvas as a text entry:

1. A deployed link to your azure website
2. User Story breakdown - Who did what....
3. Collaborate with each other and come up with 
    - What you did well
    - What you will do differently next sprint
4. Do you need anything from the instructional staff?

The instructional staff will review your current master branch in VSTS and evaluate you accordingly.

**Only push to master on sprint checkins**

## Workflow
**For each** user story given for each milestone, you must follow the following process:

**Use the VSTS Cheat Sheet as a reference on how to do each requirement**

1. Create a new user story/work item for each provided user story.  
2. Add tasks to your user story (have at least 2, but no more than 4)
3. Approve the user story that you just created
4. Assign the user story to yourself or your partner
5. Set that user story as "in progress" in your kanban board
6. create a branch for each task that you created and attached to the user story
7. Work on your user story
8. Submit a PR
9. Have your partner approve your pr (with notes possibly?)
10. Complete the task
11. Rinse and repeat for all user stories.
