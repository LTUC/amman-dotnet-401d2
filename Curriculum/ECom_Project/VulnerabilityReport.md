# Lab-38-OWASP-Vulnerability-Report
## Assignment:
- Review the [.NET OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/.NET_Security_Cheat_Sheet).
- Review your ecommerce Project and do a security vulnerability review.  
- create a `vulnerability-report.md` file inside your ecommerce site to document your identified vulnerabilities. 
- Uncover <strong>minimum</strong> 4 different vulnerabilities. 
	- If you are unable to uncover the minimum vulnerabilities, report on:
		- what a vulnerability would like (provide code examples specific for .NET Core), 
		- how to identify it
		- what code is required to fix it. 
		- Is this an issue in .NET Core? 
	- <strong> Do not just copy and paste the vulnerability specific text </strong>. Put it in your own words, explain it, learn from it. 
	- Reference any resources that you used to assist with the vulnerability report


## Example:

## Vulnerability 1
### Exposure
We found an instance of [vulnerability 1] by typing some relevant code into some vulnerable field OR by doing some edge-case thing.</p>
<br />
By exploiting [this vulnerability], we were able to retrieve XYZ attributes from the site / access to some unauthorized part of the site / something else valuable.

### Repair
problem_file1.cs and problem_file2.cshtml contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

[specific fixes here]

```csharp
	Some body of relevant code that solves our problem
```
