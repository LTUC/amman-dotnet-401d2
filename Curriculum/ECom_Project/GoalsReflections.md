# Goals and Reflections
Goals and reflections will take place every Monday/Wednesday/Friday

The point of these goals/reflections is to work with your partner
and 'recap' what you completed the past couple days and set goals for what 
you are hoping to achieve by the next goal/reflection day

### Goals

Each Goal should contain:
1. What user stories are going to be completed
1. What is your ETA on each user story

These goals are done individually in your team discussion board

### Reflections 

Each reflection should contain:

1. What was implemented (reference at least 2 different user stories each)
2. What blockers did you encounter?
3. How was the issue solved. 
4. What was your estimated time on the user story
5. What was the actual time on each user story
	- If your actual was under - what do you think helped
	- If your actual was over - why?


These reflections are done individually.

# Peer Review
1. Pick one or two user stories that you did not implement into the project, 
but your partner did. 
2. Look at how your partner implemented that feature.
3. Provide the following:
	- What you liked about the implementation
	- What you didn't like
	- How would you have done it differently?
	- Suggestions for refactoring/optimizations
	- Something that you learned
