# Goals and Reflections
Goals and reflections will take place every Monday/Wednesday/Friday

The point of these goals/reflections is to work with your partner
and 'recap' what you completed the past couple days and set goals for what 
you are hoping to achieve by the next goal/reflection day

## Goals 
Each Goal should contain in a discussion post:
1. What user stories are going to be completed
1. What is your ETA on each user story
1. What user stories are you behind on that you need to catch up?

These goals are done individually.
