# Lab 41: Intro to Xamarin

## Directions

Explore the world of mobile development by building out your own basic xamarin web app. Use the [Xamarain documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-mobile-apps-with-xamarin-forms/?WT.mc_id=learn-xamarinblog-adpatrid){:target="_blank"} to get a basic mobile app using Xamarin forms. Customize it in any way you wish to personalize the app to a specific interest that you have.

## Tests

Tests are not required for this lab.

## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** <br />
Here are the requirements for a valid readme: <br />

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to

1. tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
2. show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
3. show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
4. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
