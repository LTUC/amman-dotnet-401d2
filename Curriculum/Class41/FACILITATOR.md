# Class 41

## How do I prep for today?
Today is all about reviewing older versions of ASP.NET. The whole point of 
this lecture is to compare/contrast the differences between ASP.NET 4.8 and .NET
Core. We don't want students to not apply for positions that involve the 
older framework, so this is their look at what it looks like and how
similar they are. It's also a good opportunity for them to see how much
the framework has evolved!

Review the readings on the history of .NET, and discuss with class how we got to be
to where we are now. Can they sense patterns in how MSFT makes changes to the frameworks?
What about patterns with their releases? What can we learn from where the .NET framework
has been to where it is going?  

## What changed from yesterday? 
New topic. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
Nothing major. Just differentiating the differences of the frameworks. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
None.

## General comments

The lab for this day is completely optional. If you feel that the students
want more hands on with MVC 5, then share out the tutorial and make it a lab assignment. 

The alternative is to go through the tutorial in class. As you follow the tutorial,
have the students point out the differences and really highlight how "similar"
Core and MVC 5 are! they shouldn't be afraid to pursue positions with MVC 5.  

The students will be still working on their E-Comm site this whole week, so 
keep that in mind with their workload. They should be spending the week wrapping up 
any bug-fixes and final touches on the project.
