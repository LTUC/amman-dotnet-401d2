# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack

A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the next node in the 
stack, but does not reference it's previous. 

Common terminology for a stack is 
1. *Push* - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are considered to be *pushed*
2. *Pop* - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are *popped*
3. *Top* - This is the top of the stack

Stacks follow the **FILO** concept: **F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut.
This means that the first item in the stack, will be the last item out. 

This is what a stack looks like:
