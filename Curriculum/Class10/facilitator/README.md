# Class 10: Review Day

## How do I prep for today?
This is a review day! This is our final day of C# before hitting the web framework. Use this day to review the topics from the first 9 days and also teach the designated data structure for class 10 in the common curriculum for the implementation assignment. 

A good place to start with the review is to go over the review quizzes from week 1 and 2. 

Remind students of a few thing before entering class 11:
1. They should wrap up any pending assignments from week 2. It is suggested that they are completed with them, in it's entirety, before moving into class 11. 

1. They do not have a lab for class 11...they should use this time to complete the readings and be ready to jump into .NET Core. 

## Lecture
1. Code Review
   - Ask the students if they are having trouble with any pending assignments
