## Overview
Working in pairs, and utulize all the knowledge from the previous 2 weeks...build a lending library

### Lending Library

Build a lending library. This lending library. Here are the requirements for the library:

1. Data persistence through a text file
2. Utilize the OOP principles with class based objects. Your suggested classes should be:
	- Book
	- Author

3. Using Generics, either a custom one created by you, or a prebuilt in one, save these books
4. When the user wants to look for a specific book, use LINQ to filter out all of the books that are currently in the system
5. Allow the user to CREATE new books and add them to the file

On the Console...

1. Have the user submit their name, save that through the session
2. Give the user the option to view all of the books in the library
3. have them select a specific book to "learn more" about it
4. Allow them to search for a book under specific filters
5. Can you incorporate an interface somehow? Possibly to check out a book?
