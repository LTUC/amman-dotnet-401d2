# Class 11: Intro to ASP.NET MVC Core

## How do I prep for today?
1. What is ASP.NET Core?
	- Review what and why asp.net core is so great! 
2. What is MVC?
	- What does it stand for? How do each of these components work with each other? 
	- Start out the lecture with a drawing out MVC model and reviewing each of the components.
	- Draw out the .NET Core web request cycle with the program and startup file. (MVCDiagram.PNG)
3. How to create an MVC application
	- Start the Demo steps
4. Share the MVCSetup steps with the students

## What changed from yesterday? 
New Topic! Finally working in the web framework. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
MVC. It looks like "Magic" to them and there are a lot of 
questions about "How" and "Why". Be patient with the progression of the lecture. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
I encourage the students to keep doing the motions of how to build an MVC app. a lot of it is memorization. provide for them the steps on how to get one created (without a database). You will provide for them the database steps later on in the week.

## General comments
This is all brand new, and it's a lot of information. Be patient with the students. Repetition is key. 

Remember to share the personOfTheYear.csv file with the students for the lab.
