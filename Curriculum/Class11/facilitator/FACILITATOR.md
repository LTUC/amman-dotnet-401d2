# Class 11: Intro to ASP.NET MVC Core

## How do I prep for today?
1. Review the day's readings. Included in the readings is a video introduction to .NET Core.
1. Review MVC and how the components work with each other in ASP.NET.
1. There are 2 lab options for today, you may choose which problem domain you like better. Both have the same requirements, the only difference is the csv file contents. If you want to use the `lab-alt`, update canvas appropriately. 
1. Upload to the GitHub class repo the appropriate .csv file for whichever lab you are choosing to use for this day.
1. Upload to the MVCSetup.md file to the Resources folder in your GH class repo. 

## Lecture
1. No Code Review today
   - No time for code review today, jump right into MVC and .NET Core
1. What is ASP.NET Core?
	- Review what and why asp.net core is so great! 
2. What is MVC?
	- What does it stand for? How do each of these components work with each other? 
	- Start out the lecture with a drawing out MVC model and reviewing each of the components.
	- Draw out the .NET Core web request cycle with the program and startup file. (MVCDiagram.PNG)
3. How to create an MVC application
	- Start the Demo steps
4. Share the MVCSetup steps with the students

## Lab Notes
This lab requires that they use the System.IO content from class 03 to read in a .csv file, convert each line to a Person object and then load it into a list. They will then filter this list given the search criteria and send that data back to view.

The focus of this lab is to show the students how the 3 parts of MVC work together. Work with the students to assist them in understanding the MVC architecture as a big picture. They should be focusing less on the logic, and more on the convention.

## What changed from yesterday? 
New Topic! Finally working in the web framework. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
MVC. It looks like "Magic" to them and there are a lot of 
questions about "How" and "Why". Be patient with the progression of the lecture. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
I encourage the students to keep doing the motions of how to build an MVC app. a lot of it is memorization. provide for them the steps on how to get one created (without a database). You will provide for them the database steps later on in the week.

## General comments
This is all brand new, and it's a lot of information. Be patient with the students. Repetition is key.
