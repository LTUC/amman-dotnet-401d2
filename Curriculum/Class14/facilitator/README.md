# Class 14: Controllers and Seeding

## How do I prep for today?
Review the `lecture.md` file for an outline of the lecture.

The demo for today is rather large. Get through as much as you can. You may want to
provide for them the official demo code if you don't get all the way through. The minimum highlights that you should cover are in the outline below.

## Lecture Outline

1. Intro to APIS
   - What are they?
   - APIs doc in resources
1. Scaffolding out controllers
   - Review the code
   - notice the DBContext getting "injected"
1. Postman Requests
   - Use postman to make requests to your API server
1. User Secrets
   - Enable them in Startup


## What changed from yesterday? 

Building off of yesterday's demo, pick up where you left off. 
The "code review" today should be a review of what the DB Context does, how
to create and register it, and how to create the scripts.

Keep repeating these concepts over and over again...

## What might students struggle with today?  
Today is a wind down day before Career Coaching typically. We cover a lot of "random" topics today.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
Scaffolding a controller is like "magic", it's not... and work with the students so they understand that it is not. The typical feedback from the scaffolding is the difficult understanding of the code. Encourage the students to read what is going on and comment the code. 

If they don't take the time to understand the code.. their lab will be challenging.
