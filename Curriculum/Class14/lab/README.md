# Lab 14: Entity Framework & Seeding

## The Problem Domain
To continue with your AsyncInn Hotel Management System, you need to seed hotel data to display in your application. 
For Today's branch, focus on working within the existing code base from prior labs. Today, we practice learning and understanding a code base that you didn't write, but need to make modifications too.

## Application Specifications


1. Scaffold out a controller for each of your entity models. Choose the "API Controller with actions, using Entity Framework" and choose one of your 5 entities as your data source and your existing DBContext as your "Data context class." You should have a total of 5 scaffolded Controllers when completed.
1. Test your routes in Postman to confirm you are retrieving data correctly from the seeded data.
1. To keep your application secure, enable the use of UserSecrets in your application. Update your constructor in your `Startup.cs` file as required.

## Unit Tests
- There are no Unit Tests required for this assignment.

Unit tests to come in a future lab.

## Stretch Goals

- Try and add data to your database through postman and your API endpoints. 

## Additional Resources
- There are no additional resources provided for this assignment.

## README
**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** 
Here are the requirements for a valid readme:

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to

1. Tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
1. Show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
1. Show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
1. Tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
