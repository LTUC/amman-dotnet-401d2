# Class 29

## How do I prep for today?
Lecture Overview:
1. Code Review - Give an in class data structure challenge! - 1 hour max!
   - Have the studetns do it independently on a piece of paper in class. 
   - Either go over the solution as a class, or have one student whiteboard their solution and 
   in front of the class. 
1. [Add Roles to a user](./Resources/roles.md) - 1 hour
1. [Custom claim based policy](./Resources/policies.md) - 1 hour

## What changed from yesterday? 

## What might students struggle with today?  

Historically, it's been a struggle for students to create their own custom policy. The curriculum has
been reworked now so that instead of doing a custom claims based policy, they are simply
adding Roles to the app, and having policies for `HasClaim` and `IsInRole`. 
These get the point across, and is less complex to understand.

If you really want to show them how to create a new custom claims based policy, the 
documenation on the microsoft docs for minimum age is easy to follow and a good demo. 


## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?

## General comments

This is the end of Sprint 1! Remind the students of a few things:
1. Submission of a deployed Azure Website 
2. Completed Azure DevOps Kanban Board (with the proper sprint label)
3. User Stories need to be properly filled out. 
4. Peer reviews close 48 hours after the Sprint is due.
5. Sprint Canvas assignment closes 48 hours after it's due. 
6. Keep communicating with partners!


The topic for today is only partially compelted inthe lab. Instead of having 
the students create a custom policy, the student is just required to 
create an admin panel and crate an "Admin Only" policy. 

Historically having the student create their own custom claims based policy
has not produced good results and it usually holds the student up
from moving forwad in the project. You should still show the students 
how to do so in class...but it is not required for implementation.
