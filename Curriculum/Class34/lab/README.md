# Lab 32: Sprint 2 - Milestone #3

## User Stories & Guidance:

1. (Developer 1 & 2 & 3) As a developer, I would like to use other third party options to register and sign up for an account on the site so that I don't have to create a custom registration.


### Guidance

**User Story 1:** For each developer that is working on this project, incorporate one provider as an option for login/registration on the site. (example: 2 developers will mean 2 OAUTH/3rd party provider options)


## Tests
