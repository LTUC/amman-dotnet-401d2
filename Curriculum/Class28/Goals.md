# Goals 
Goals will take place every Monday and Wednesday. 

The point of these goals  is to work with your partner and plan out what you plan on accomplishing over the next few days. 

Each Goal should contain in a discussion post:
1. What user stories are going to be completed
1. What is your ETA on each user story
1. What user stories are you behind on that you need to catch up?

These goals are done individually.
