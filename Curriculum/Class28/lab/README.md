# Lab 28: Sprint 1 - Milestone #3

## User Stories & Guidance:

### User Stories
1. (Developer 2) As a User, I would like custom claims to be captured upon registration of the site. 
1. (Developer 1 & 3) As a user, I would like the home page to showcase and reflect the products that we are selling.
1. (Developer 1) As a user, I would like to be able to easily login and register for the site from the home page so that the user can quickly get started.
1. (Developer 1) As a user, I would like to be greet the user on their homepage so that they can be assured they succesfully logged into their account. 

### Guidance

**User Story 2:** Capture a couple other claims from the user...this can all be directly related to what you capture from the 
registration process. As we develop the site, you can continue to add claims as needed. Remember that each time you add a new 
claim..old users will not have that claim so you may need to delete/reset your database of users. Here are some ideas of claims 
you can collect:
	- First Name, Last Name 
	- Birthday
	- Email
	- Favorite Color


**User Story 3:** Add some HTML and CSS to your home page. Customize it so that it is tailored to your product you are selling. 
Some ideas may be to "feature" products on your homepage! Have fun, make it look professional. In addition, add navigation to all of your external pages. 

**User Story 4:** Within your Homepage, include a link to easily Register or Login. Traditionally, these are located in your 
homepage navigation. This link can just redirect to the appropriate page. We will build onto this functionality once the user is logged in during Milestone 3, so don't stress about customizing the login/logout experience just yet. 

**User Story 5:**  For this user story, you need to capture the user's first and last name upon registration . You also want to create the claim of the user's first and last name as a "Name" claim. Take this claim, and display it somewhere that will be visible to the user. Generally, it's a good idea to be able to use the user's name after they login, because it gives them a more personalized experience. Display this in the nav bar potentially that says "Hi, Amanda!". This can be done in your layouts, to display on all pages of your site, or you can have a cool design on the homepage that tactfully displays the users name. Get creative, and 
let the user know you care :)
