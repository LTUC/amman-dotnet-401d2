=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- create a new branch named `lab01-`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab06-amanda`
- write your code
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas
- Include a Readme.md (contents described below)

## Directions
Building off of your lab05, add interfaces to both the diagram and the codebase. 
1. Create a minimum of 2 interfaces.
	- Each interface created should be implemented by more than one class.
	- Have at least one class implement more than one interface
- Test your code with Unit testing
- Label interfaces as `<interface>`

## Tests
Test the site for the following functionality
1. Prove that the classes that implement the interface actually implement it
2. Prove inheritance
3. Prove Polymorphism
	- Prove methos have been overwritten
	- Prove that one of your concrete animals `is an` Animal

## ReadMe

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** <br />
Here are the requirements for a valid readme: <br />

Add the following to your current readme:
1. Define what an interface is in your own words
1. Describe what your interfaces are, where are they being implemented, and why. Provide Examples.
1. Updated diagram with your interfaces mapped out. 


## Rubric
- 14pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions.

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	14       | Program runs as expected, no exceptions during execution |
	10       | Program meets all of the  functionality requirements described above (including tests) // Program runs/compiles, Program contains logic/process errors|
	8       | Program meets most of the functionality requirements descibed above (including tests)  // Program runs/compiles, but throws exceptions during execution |
	6       | Program missing most of the functionality requirements descibed above // Program runs/compiles |
	4       | Missing Readme Document // Readme Document does not meet standards |
	0       | Program does not compile/run. Build Errors // Required naming conventions not met |
	0       | No Submission |

- 6pts: Code meets industry standards
	- These points are only awardable if you score at minimum a 5/7 on above criteria

	Points  | Reasoning | 
	 ------------ | :-----------: | 
	6       | Code meets Industry Standards // methods and variables namings are appropriate // Selective and iterative statements are used appropriately, Fundamentals are propertly executed // Clearly and cleanly commented |
	4       | syntax for naming conventions are not correct (camelCasing and PascalCasing are used appropriately) // slight errors in use of fundamentals // Missing some comments |
	2       | Inappropriate naming conventions, and/or inappropriate use of fundamentals // Code is not commented  |
	0       | No Submission or incomplete submission |
