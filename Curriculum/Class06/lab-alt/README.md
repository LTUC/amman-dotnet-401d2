Lab 6: Interfaces
=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- Building off of your repo from Lab 5:
- Create a branch named `NAME-LAB##`
- Write your code
- Commit often
- Push to your repository
- Create a pull request from your branch back your `master` branch.
- Submit a link to your PR in canvas
- Merge your PR back into master
- In Canvas, Include the actual time it took you to complete the assignment as a comment (**REQUIRED**)
- Include a `README.md` (contents described below)

## The Problem Domain
***This is part 2 of a 2 part assignment***

Building off of Lab 5....
1. Add these interfaces onto your map hierarchy. Label each interfaces as `<interface>`
1. Create a minimum of 2 interfaces.
	- Each interface created should be implemented by more than one class.
	- Have at least one class implement more than one interface

1. When running your application, it should output each of the concrete vehicles and one 
behavior that it has inherited without any direct code manipulation

## Program Specifications

Your solution should include the following:
- Have at least 3 different abstract classes
- Have at least 3 layers of inheritance
- Have at least 5 concrete vehicles
- Have at least 2 abstract methods (make sure you override them)
- Have at least 2 abstract Properties (make sure you override them)
- Have at least 2 virtual methods (make sure you override at least one of them)
- Have at least 2 virtual properties (make sure you override at least one of them)
- Have at least 2 interfaces properly implemented onto classes (as described above)
- Your (digital) drawing of your vehicle diagram should be clearly labeled

## Unit Tests
Adding additional tests with the following functionality: 
1. Test that the classes that implement the interface actually implement it
1. Test inheritance
1. Test polymorphism
	- Prove methods have been overridden
	- Prove that one of your concrete vehicles `is an` Vehicle

## Stretch Goals
No stretch goal for this lab

## Additional Resources
- Please refer to the in-class diagram and code base as an example of the expectation.


## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.** <br />
Here are the requirements for a valid readme: <br />

Add the following to your current readme from Lab 5/Part 1:
1. Define what an interface is in your own words
1. Describe what your interfaces are, where are they being implemented, and why. Provide Examples.
1. Updated diagram with your interfaces mapped out. 

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
