=====================================
## Learning Objectives
1. The student will understand the difference between inheritance and interfaces.
2. The student will be able to set up a hierarchy of classes that both inherit from a base class and implement at least one interface. 

## Lecture Outline

### Interfaces vs Inheritance
* Review inheritance
    * no multiple inheritance
* Implementing an interface
    * naming conventions
    * properties
    * methods

### Demo
* Create simple inheritance hierarchy
* Create interface examples in hierarchy
    * demo naming conventions: *ie* IDrive v. IDriveable
    * demo lack of access modifiers in interfaces
    * demo logical placement of methods: *ie* StartCar() would be a method in a Person class, not on the IDriveable interface
