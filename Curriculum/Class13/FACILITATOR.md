# Class 13: Intro to Entity Framework Core

## How do I prep for today?
Post the solution to the previous day's lab right away. spend the first 20 minutes or so reviewing 
the solution and explanation behind the ERD. 

Code Review: Build out an MVC app again. This MVC that your building out will carry over
into lecture, so use this MVC app during lecture to build off of.

Resources:
1. [Async Inn ERD Solution](./Resources/AsyncInn2.png)
   - This is not the *only* solution, just one possible. If a student has a different solution that also
   looks correct talk about the differences and why. The wonderful thing about architecture is that it
    can be different from each other and still be correct.

Outline for the day:
1. Intro to Entity Framework Core
2. Build out an MVC app with default home page
2. Creation of DbContext
3. Register the DBContext in Startup
3. Create relationships between entities

## What changed from yesterday? 
Taking the ERD from the lab and implementing the models into code.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?


## General comments
For this day and lab, focus on just getting things set up. No HTML/CSS is required, only
the home controller is needed, but just a basic greeting.
