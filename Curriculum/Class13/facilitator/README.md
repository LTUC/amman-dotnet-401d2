# Class 13: Intro to Entity Framework Core

## How do I prep for today?

Post the solution to the previous day's lab right away. Spend the first 20 minutes or so reviewing the solution and explanation behind the ERD. 

Add the solution of Async Inn ERD to a resources folder in the class GH repo

Code Review: Build out an MVC app again. This MVC that your building out will carry over
into lecture, so use this MVC app during lecture to build off of.

Resources:
- [Async Inn ERD Solution](./Resources/AsyncInn2.png)
   - This is not the *only* solution, just one possible. If a student has a different solution that also
   looks correct talk about the differences and why. The wonderful thing about architecture is that it can be different from each other and still be correct.

## Lecture
1. Intro to Entity Framework Core
1. Build out an MVC app with default home page
1. Build out Entity Models (with nav props)
1. Creation of DbContext
1. Register the DBContext in Startup
1. Create relationships between entities

## What changed from yesterday? 
Taking the ERD from the lab and implementing the models into code. 

## What might students struggle with today?  
Code first migrations, as well as creation and registration of DBContext

## General comments
For this day and lab, focus on just getting things set up. No HTML/CSS is required, only
the home controller is needed, but just a basic greeting.
