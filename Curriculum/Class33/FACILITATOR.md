# Class 33

## How do I prep for today?
1. Code Review 
   - Code Challenge! Give the students a code challenge
   for them to complete individually on a piece of paper for 30 minutes. 
 - Once time is up either go over the solution in class or have one person walk through
 on the whiteboard. 
2. Intro to OAUTH and adding user roles
   - Draw out diagram of how the handshake is happening. 
2. Demo of implemenation of OAuth
   - Demonstrate with the students on Google or Microsoft. Twitter and 
   Facebook are not usually good options. 
    - The students will not be doing this in their lab. if they want to they can, but
given the inconsistancies with third party providers, its not always reliable. 

## What changed from yesterday? 
Still building off of demos from prior days

## What might students struggle with today?  
OAuth is unpredicable. It doesn't always work. be prepared to debug. 

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
see above. 

## General comments
OAuth is important to know what is going on, be sure to spend some time on what is going on 
when drawing through the diagramm. the code will be a challenge, so be patient and i reccomend 
pre-demoing the code before class with the 3rd party you will demonstrate. ensure that it works.
