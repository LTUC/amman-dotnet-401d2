# Lab 37: Sprint 3 - Milestone #3

Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## User Stories & Guidance:

1. (Developer 2) As an admin, I would like to be redirected to the admin dashboard upon login
1. (Developer 1 & 3) As an admin, I want to be able to see all of orders that have been submitted from the admin dashboard

### Guidance

**User Story 1:** When the user logs in, check the roles that they are associated with. If they are an admin, redirect them to the admin dashboard instead of the home page. 

**User Story 2:**  Within the Admin dashboard, add the ability for the admin to see all of the orders that were submitted. The admin should be able to quickly see:
1. The name of the Customer
1. The date of the order
1. The total price of the order

Each order should link to an individual order page that will give full order details including individual line items.
