# Class 45: Final Project Kickoff

## Overview
Today the students will start the kickoff of their
final project. Throughout the week, the students
should have already agreed on a project and created a repo. 


## How do I prep for today?
There isn't much prep for today. it's mostly student driven. 
The students should be working on the following through the day:

1. Wireframes
2. Software Reqs
3. User Stories
4. Database Schema/ERD

Allow the students the whole lecture/lab time to
create these.

Students should not be allowed to "code" anything within their project
until Class 46. They can only prep and plan today.

## What changed from yesterday?

## What might students struggle with today?

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?

## General comments

the students to take the last 20 weeks of "learning how to learn"
and put it to use. They should have fun!
