# Lab: Testing and Swagger and Deployment

Bring your current AsyncInn project "up to spec"

1. Summary Comments on all services and interfaces
1. Add Swagger Documentation
1. Test at least 2 services to ensure the CRUD operations work as expected
   - Have your tests running in automated fashion at GitHub, using Actions
1. Deploy the app to Azure
1. Test your routes on Postman as well as Swagger to confirm you are getting the correct data

## Submission Notes:

> Provide a LIVE (Deployed) link to your app running at Azure, with the Swagger Docs as the home page. We will use this to make our grading assertions on your routes.

## README

**A Readme is a requirement. No Readme == No Grade.**
Here are the requirements for a valid readme:

A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.

Your job is to

1. Tell them what it is (with context, provide a summary)
1. Show them what it looks like in action (Visuals)
1. Show them how they use it (Step by step directions, "Happy Path" walk through)
1. Tell them any other relevant details

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

Refer to the README templates in the class repo `Resources` folder for an example.
