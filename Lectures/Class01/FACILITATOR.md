## General comments
Since this is the first day, There isn't really much to review. <br />
Spend the First hour talking about the structure of the class. the Syllabus, Late assignment policy, Learning Journals and anything else you may seem important. <br />
Talk about the history of C#. Where it came from. Where it's at now. And how .NET has evolved to .NET core since 2001. <br />S
Spend the second hour of the course reviewing the Prework Calculator assignment. Talk
about methods, main, arguments, paramters etc.... spend no more than an hour on this. I would reccomend running it like a traditional code review..<br >
Spend the third hour introducing the new topic Try/Catch/Finally throw.
