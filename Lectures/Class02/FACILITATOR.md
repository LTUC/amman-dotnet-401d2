## What might students struggle with today? 
- Students may struggle with the concept of Test Driven Development.
- Many of the students don't fully know how to break down problems from a large abstract probelem domain to smaller components
- You will find yourself encouraging students to "think simplier", eventually after a few tries, they get the hang of it ;)

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?


## General comments
- Code Katas should not be a brand new concept to the students. it looks like this is something that 
they went over in 301 from their coding challenges. 

- The First kata in the lab assignment is only supposed to be a markup/psuedo code write up. The whole point of that kata
is to help students practice taking sormething abstract like pricing produce and break it down to smaller parts. What kind of edge cases
can they come up with? What kind of 'sales' do they encounter while at the store...essentially - what does the checkout machine 'do' when 
they are checking out? I like to refer to this as an example of sitting with a PM and a client in a req meeting. It is the developers job
to start understanding the domain and ask appropriate questions and get as many facts as they can before they code. this is a goood practiee for that.
