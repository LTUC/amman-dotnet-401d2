=====================================

## Learning Objectives
1. The student will know and understand where and when to use a LINQ queries against a collection to extract data
2. Students will undestand the use of a Lambda statemetn and how to join them with LINQ queries

## Lecture Outline
- Review collections
  - Create a collection
  - Add data to the collection
  - iterate through the collection

1. What is an easier way to search for items in a collection?

## What is LINQ?
