> NOTE: Your team workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow.[Azure DevOps CheatSheet](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/curriculum/projects/ecommerce/azure-devops-cheatsheet)

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## Admin Dashboard

Using Forms and CRUD Enabled Routes, add the ability for administrators to add, edit, delete new product categories, products, and assign products to categories. This will allow us to completely "set up" our inventory for selling on the storefront.

### User Stories and Tasks
