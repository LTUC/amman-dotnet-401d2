# Class 06

## How do I prep for today?
1. Upload the demo code to the class repository. This will serve as an example for the students on what is expected for their lab.
1. Be prepared to go over the required data structure this day. Refer to the Common Curriculum Day 5 implementation on what data structure to teach.
1. There is an alternative lab that you may optionally choose. The initial lab is creating a zoo, the alternative lab is creating a vehicle dealership. Both have the same requirements, just different problem domains.

## Lecture
1. Code Review
   - Review the basics of classes and objects
1. Introduce OOP
     - Inheritance 
     - Abstraction
     - Polymorphism
     - Encapsulation

Included in the DemoCode folder is an example of a diagram that you can draw with the class as you 
go over the OOP principles. There is also the code base when converting the diagram to Visual Studio. 


### OOP Principles (90 minutes)

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Item
- **What** (10 min)
  - Item 
- **How** (30 min)
  - See Resource
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - item
- **In-Class Exercise** (30 minutes)
  - Inheritance: Using the same problem domain as we did on class 04, Build out a pizza store class and have it inherit down a new pizza store
  - Abstraction: Make the parent level pizza store abstract
  - Polymorphism: Set methods such as "OrderPizza" virtual to allow different ways to order
    - Allow methods like "MakePizza" abstract to require each store to set their own reqs on how to make the pizza
  - Encapsulation: Set the appropariate internal information private vs general props and methods public


## Lab Notes
Today is part 1 of a 2 part lab. In today's lab they will:
1. Draw/plan out a hierarchy chart of classes. This drawing should be present in their lab README.
1. Implement the classes and behaviors within Visual Studio. The hierarchy chart should match the implementation.
1. Tests to prove the OOP principles.

## What changed from yesterday? 
N/A

## What might students struggle with today? 
- The actual reasoning and implementation behind the OOP principles usually go pretty smoothly. I have found 
breaking it down by each principle and showing how it looks in both the diagram and the VS code helps concrete the idea/concept.

## What bugs, issues, or surprises have come up in the past for this class?
- N/A

## General comments
This is a good day to encourage class interaction while building out the demo code together.
