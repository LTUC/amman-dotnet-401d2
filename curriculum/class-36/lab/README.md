# Lab 36: Sprint 3 - Milestone #1

Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. 

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## User Stories & Guidance:

1. (Developer 1) As a user, I would like a dedicated page that shows my account specific information
2. (Developer 2) As a user, I would like to view all of my prior orders

### Guidance

**User Story 1**:Â Create a new route for `/account` with a razor page that shows the users information. Allow the user to change their Name, Address, and any other information you feel important. Stretch: Have them change their password!

**User Story 2:** Have a page that is accessible frome the profile page that shows all the orders the user has individually created. A stretch goal is to recreate the receipt when the user clicks on the order, MVP is to just have the order date and total listed from newest to oldest.
