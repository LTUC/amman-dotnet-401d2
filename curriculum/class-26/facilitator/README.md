   - Walk through the creation of a repo and cloning it down to your Visual Studio. 
   - Create a basic scaffolded MVC app w/ a database in class following the Azure Dev Ops work flow
        - The demo provided is using User Secrets, so don't forget to include the User secrets file and Connection String file!

   - Peer reviews at the end of each sprint
   - Show an example of Day 1's (and 2's if they need to see the "guidance" section) user stories and how they are split up
   - Everyone is responsible for their own submission (no "group" submissions)
   - Show the grading rubric for sprint 1

1. Introduce MVC
    - Review what MVC stands for. Use the Resources of MVC, and the Diagram to assist
    - Lab will create a basic MVC app and use the "ceareal.csv" file as day's data set. They should build out a Products page using MVC controller views from the dataset.


### LAB Prep
Have student pairs ready to be posted in Canvas. For lab, each group should be expected to:
- Create a Dev Ops account
  - Only one person needs to do this. Have them invite their partner.
  - Deploy the basic app to Azure (only on one of the accounts)
