# Readings: Ethics

## Submission Requirements

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Review at least one article ***from both "Ethics in the workplace" and "Ethics in Technology" sections below*** and write how each of them relates to ethics in technology. Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article? 

For each article that you choose, write a ***minimum*** 5 sentences (1 paragraph). Each post should be something of substance and of an acceptable quality. 

Go through these resources, and create a wiki entry in your fork of the class repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a Code 301-level student interested in learning about it.
