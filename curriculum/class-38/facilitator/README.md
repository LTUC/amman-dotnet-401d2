# Facilitators Guide: Xamarin: Device Features

## Overview

Today's mobile devices give us a wide array of hardware features such as the Accelerometer, Camera, GPS, etc. By tapping into these features, we can add new dimensions to our applications.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous classes, the students will have built a basic application that can use Xamarin forms or other input to save data to the device.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be tapping into hardware features to make our apps more than simply doing mobile CRUD

**Where we're headed**:
The students will have a full day ahead of them to make a mobile application of their own design and feature set.

### TOPIC 1

Continue to do your demo workshop or mob-programming style with the students. Because the demos are short, everyone should be able to follow along and enter their own lab time with a working self-written demo.
