# Facilitators Guide: React II

## Overview

This class covers the 6 remaining "main topics" of React.

- Conditional Rendering
- Lists and Keys
- Forms
- Lifting State Up
- Composition vs Inheritance
- Thinking in React

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class React was introduced.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be rounding out basic knowledge of React.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on data fetching & authentication.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are ability to add navigation and more advanced rendering to previous class's app.

## Preparation

- Read up on the remaining "main concepts" in React docs.
  - Links in [DISCUSSION.md](../DISCUSSION.md)
- Get ready for questions about how to properly track flow of data.
- Look at previous course student submissions for insight as to what you might see in code review.
- Practice [the demo](../demo/magic-eight-ball)

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Code Review

- Make note of student questions from previous lab. You can often address those questions when building out the demo from scratch.

### React Main Concepts - Continued

- **Why**
  - It is much easier to be effective with React if you can "think in React"
  - For example, Forms in React are often difficult at first. But React forms make sense when you keep in mind that "UI should be a pure projection of state."
    - In other words, React is declarative.
- **What**
  - Cover each of the remaining "main concepts" in React.
- **How**
  - Go through each concept, most likely in order. BUT I recommend covering "Thinking in React" first and refer back to it at as you go through the other steps.
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Have class go through the create-next-app process
  - See what they can do from scratch with a few minutes in a breakout room.

### Next.js Routing

- **Why**
  - Devs may call these kinds of apps "single page" but end users don't care.- They want to navigate site the way they're used to.
- **What**
  - Next.js gives you routing out of the box.
  - No browser-router, etc.
    - Though you can still use tools like that when needed.
- **How**
  - Next.js makes it dead simple.
  - Throw a component file in `pages` folder and you're good to go.
  - It even works with dynamic routes.

## Lab Notes

- Students will hopefully trust the process from their time with  Django where there were hit with a lot of bewildering code that became familiar with repetition.
- They may need reminders to trust the process ;)

## What might students struggle with today?

- The combo of Next/React style, JSX and modern JS likely to be overwhelming.

## Past bugs, issues or surprises

- NPM installation issues occasionally crop up.
