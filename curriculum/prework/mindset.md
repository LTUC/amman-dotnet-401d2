# Prework - Mindset

## Tasks

While this course is a coding course, success with the deluge of work within depends heavily on the mindset that you bring to the table.
With that in mind, this is some prework to get us all on the same page about dealing with difficulty in our lives.

Note: If you've already watched/read/listened to the below before, just take some time and revisit them.
We could all use mindset reminders.

## Submitting Your Work

There will be a discussion assignment on Canvas focusing on mindsets.
You are to post in that discussion assignment with your thoughts and feelings about these various media.
Each should be addressed, and each time one is addressed you should write **at least** 2-3 sentences about your reaction.
Replies to others' comments are not mandatory but appreciated.
Keep it civil.
