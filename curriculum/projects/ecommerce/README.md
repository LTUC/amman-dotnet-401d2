# E-Commerce Store Application

## Problem Domain

You have just landed a new client that has requested you build them a shiny new website. Specifically, the client wants you to build them an E-Commerce store where they can sell individual products! Unfortunately, this client also doesn't know what to sell...so they are offering 50% of the product profits if you provide a product as well. You have graciously agreed to the proposal and now have a very large task on hand! After speaking with the client further, you have learned a few things that the site must have:

Your client has requested you build the site in ASP.NET Core. They would like user management that includes registration as well as login/logout capabilities.Your client is extremely cautious of security though. In order to meet your client's request, they are requesting you use the most secure hashing algorithms to protect the identity of all users.

The client would like the website to be published and hosted on Azure Cloud Services. They are also requesting that you take advantage of a few of Azure's built in resources such as the SendGrid email sender and Cloud BLOB Storage.

As this is an e-commerce store, the client would like some of the traditional features that most e-commerce stores contain. They expect full payment processing of financial transactions as well as well standard basket management. Items should be added and removed from a basket as customers browse the site, as well as visibly of their basket when navigating through the pages. The client would like the customer to see a receipt as well as a receipt to be mailed to each customer after every completed transaction. Be sure to welcome your customers and viewers of your site with a welcoming home page as well as individual pages for each product that tells the customer more details.

Each customer should have a personal account where they can view their personal information as well as their previously submitted orders. An Admin should have access to an "Admin Dashboard" where they will be able to manage products, orders, and customers.

## Breakdown
The client has given you a timeline of 4 weeks to delivery. You have broken this down into 3 week long sprints, with the final week dedicated to last minute bug fixes and prep before final deployment.

Each sprint is broken down into 3-4 days worth of milestones, with each milestone containing specific user stories. It is your job to work within your team and implement each of these user stories to build out the e-commerce store. To assist with your project management, you and your team have opted into using Azure Dev Ops to assist with the maintenance of the project.

This project will provide an insight of building a project from "zero to hero". Work together with your team, practice your communication and project management skills, and have fun!


## Project Structure
The project will be broken up into 2  sprints. Each sprint consists of 4 class days.

Sprints will end on Fridays (Mon-Thursday Lectures), in which you will also have your weekly check-in.

After every milestone, you will do a retro on your progress so far and what is left on your tasks.

At the end of each sprint, you will conduct a Peer Review on a few of your partner's user stories. Be sure to understand what exactly was completed and input any feedback or suggestions for optimizations or alternative approaches. Remember, this is just feedback and review -- keep it respectable and professional.

Use this project as an opportunity to ask questions, learn what it's like to work on a team with a full Agile process, and have fun with it!
