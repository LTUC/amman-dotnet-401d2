# Sprint 3 Requirements

These are the expectations for Sprint 3.

You will only have 48 hours from the initial due date of this sprint to submit your work. Anything past the 48 hours will not be accepted and you will receive a zero for this sprint. Each individual is responsible for their own submission. 

Re-sumbits for this sprint will only be accepted upon evaluation of sprint 3:

For example, Your team received feedback that you need to fix an error in one or two of your milestones. Instead of doing a submission and pushing to master halfway through your sprint 3, you will be required to **explicitly** tell your grader what you want them to regrade from sprint 2 when you submit for sprint 3. You will not be able to do any additional "resubmits" for sprint 2 once sprint 3 is due and graded. Plan accordingly.

You will each individually submit the following into Canvas as a text entry:

1. A deployed link to your azure website
1. Collaborate with each other and come up with 
    - What you did well
    - What you will do differently next sprint
1. Do you need anything from the instructional staff?

The instructional staff will review your current master branch in VSTS/Azure Dev Ops and evaluate you accordingly.

**Only push to master on sprint check-ins**


### README REQUIREMENTS
Your readme should contain the following:
  - Link to your deployed website
  - What is the product you are selling?
  - What claims are you capturing? Why?
  - What Policies are you enforcing? Why?
  - Structure/Database Schema for your store DB (not identity)
  - Explanation of your DB Schema (mostly interested in your basket/order tables)
  

The readme is important because it helps the instructional team grade your site. it is their guide/map
to your configuration and settings of your web application.
