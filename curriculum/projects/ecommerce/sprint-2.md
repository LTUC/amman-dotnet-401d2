# E-Commerce Application: Sprint 2

## Submission Schedule

You will have 4 Class/Lab days to work on this sprint.

You will only have 48 hours from the initial due date of this sprint to submit your work. Anything past the 48 hours will not be accepted, and you will receive a zero for this sprint. Each individual is responsible for their own submission.

Re-Submits for this sprint will only be accepted upon evaluation of sprint 2:

For example, Your team received feedback that you need to fix an error in one or two of your milestones. Instead of doing a submission and pushing to master halfway through your sprint 2, you will be required to **explicitly** tell your grader what you want them to regrade from sprint 1 when you submit for sprint 2. You will not be able to do any additional "resubmits" for sprint 1 once sprint 2 is due and graded. Plan accordingly.

You will each individually submit the following into Canvas as a text entry:

1. A deployed link to your azure website
2. Collaborate with each other and come up with
  - What you did well
  - What you will do differently next sprint
3. Do you need anything from the instructional staff? (these comments are confidential and only shared with instructional staff)

The instructional staff will review your current master branch in Azure Dev Ops and evaluate you based on the rubric below.
