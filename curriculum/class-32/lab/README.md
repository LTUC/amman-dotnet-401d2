Work together with your partner(s) to complete this lab.

> NOTE: Your team workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow.[Azure DevOps CheatSheet](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/curriculum/projects/ecommerce/azure-devops-cheatsheet)

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## Consumer Site (The Storefront)

Now that we have valid users, and the ability to browse the inventory, it's time to allow our registered customers the ability to add items to their "Shopping Cart"

This is going to require both a shopping cart page where they can view the full contents of what they're about to purchase as well as a mini-cart component that can be used on any page.

### User Stories and Tasks

Divide your work evenly amongst your team members.

1. As a user, I would like a way to store the items I wish to purchase in a cart within the application.
1. As a user, I would like the ability to view my desired purchases while browsing the other products on the site.
1. As a user I would like a dedicated page where I can view all the products I wish to purpose all in one location.

### Guidance / Questions

- How does your ERD need to change to allow for orders?
- What models will you now need to create?
- Do you need additional authenticated routes?

## Tests

1. Test the ability to browse categories
1. Test the inability to add items to a shopping cart without being logged in
1. Test the CRUD operations on the cart itself
