# Razor Pages

Use this document to gain an understanding of the technology and an idea of how the day should flow. This is not to be used as a main source of lecture, but an outline of what should be covered at minimum.

## What are Razor Pages

Razor Pages are new to .NET Core specifically and are an alternative architectural pattern to how your site is constructed. It still utilizes MVC and it's routing, but is more of an MVVM approach to web development.

MVVM stands for Model-View-View Model. This means
that the data flow between the client and the server bypass the controller and communicate through the `PageModel` in the Razor Page.

Razor Pages are used to help simplify development and separate individual pages a bit more with MVC.

The advantage of razor pages is there is a lot less "magic" happening. This means that we have a bit more control, as developers, of what is happening in the data flow pipeline.

## Why

Razor Pages allow us to really utilize the "Single Responsibility" principle within practice. This means that we can guarantee that our Models are really only doing "one" thing and only one thing.

Razor Pages are great for any form of HTML views that we need within our web app.

MVC and Razor Pages can live in harmony within one web app, it is not an either/or situation.

We can continue to use controllers for your default routing, or for APIs. Use Razor Pages for other functional pages within your app that required HTML and views! This separation keeps our app clean and easy to work with .

## How

Razor Pages have what's called a "PageModel". This is the model that will be presented to the user and the data that will be transferred back and forth.

We will use this PageModel to define our Actions (Get and Post), as well as
define the shape of what data we should expect.

Let's start with a demo:

### Demo

The final demo code for the day is included in the *Demo* folder.
Refer to this demo for further reference on how to implement the day's tasks.

1. Add `endpoints.MapRazorPages();` middleware in your `Configure()` method.
1. Create a Pages Folder
1. Create an Account Folder
1. Create a new Razor Page for Register
    - Introduce the PageModel
    - Introduce SignInManager
    - Introduce UserManager
    - Create a nested class to hold Register input data
      - Consider introducing what a "nested class" is
1. Add Code to OnGet
   - Discuss with the students what `OnGet` is and why it's used.
1. Create the HTML for the view with a form
1. Add Code to OnPost
   - Discuss with the students what `OnPost` is and why it's used.
   - Walk/code through what happens during the process of a Register.
