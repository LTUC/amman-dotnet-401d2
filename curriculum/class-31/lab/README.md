> NOTE: Your team workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow. [Azure DevOps CheatSheet](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/Curriculum/ECom_Project/AzureDevOps_CheatSheet)

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## Consumer Site (The Storefront)

We'll now switch our attention to the consumer side of our online storefront, building out a system whereby our potential customers can register for an account and shop for products. While we'll allow them to shop and browse, it's imperative that shoppers not be permitted to add an item to their cart until they've both registered for an account and are logged in.

### User Stories and Tasks

Divide your work evenly amongst your team members.

1. As a user, I would like to see products available for sale so that I can browse through the inventory for purchase.
1. As a user, I would like to register for an account on the site, so that I can make purchases
1. As a user, I would like to securely login to my account so that I can add products to my shopping cart

### Guidance / Questions

- Scaffold out the shopper dashboard workflow using Razor Pages
  - What are all of the desired user pathways through the site?
  - What pages do you need?
  - What data do you need to make each page function properly?
- How can we allow users to browse anonymously, but only add to cart once registered?

## Tests

1. Test the ability to browse categories
1. Test the inability to add items to a shopping cart without being logged in
