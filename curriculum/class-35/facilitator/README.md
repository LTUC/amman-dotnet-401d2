# Class 35

## How do I prep for today?
1. No prep for today. 

## Lecture Outline
1.Code Review
   - Troubleshoot with the students any standing issues they have with their e-commerce projects
   - Have a group showcase their e-commerce project and discuss their strategies/issues
1. Data Structure practice!
  - If there is a data structure lecture for Common Curriculum, this is a good time to present this lecture
  - If there is no set Data Structure lecture, consider going over some of the code challenges or conducting one to the class as practice.

## Lab Notes
No milestone for this day. Just a catch up day.
