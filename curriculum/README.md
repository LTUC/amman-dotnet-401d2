# 401 ASP.NET Core Curriculum Overview

The ASP.NET curriculum focuses on the following learning outcomes

1. Fundamentals of the C# language and Object Oriented Programming
1. ReST API Development
1. Entity Framework
1. Authentication and Authorization using the Identity Framework
1. MVC and Razor Pages
1. React UI
1. Unity Game Development

## C# Fundamentals

The first 2 modules consist of introduction to C#. You will spend the next 10 classes teaching the students C# and getting them ready to go into ASP.NET Core web development. ASP.NET Core assumes an intermediate knowledge of C#, so we have 10 classes to get the students to that level. The focus on these 2 weeks is primarily computer-science related and does not work with the web. The lab assignments are all console apps and focus on practicing the c# concepts taught daily.

### Module 1 - C# Basics

Quiz 2

## API Development

Modules 3 & 4 introduce the concept of web development. The students will dive into MVC and learn what an MVC application consists of. They will model a database with an ERD and create a hotel asset management system through the course of the 2 weeks using ASP.NET MVC Core and Dependency Injection. They will end this module with an intro to REST APIs in ASP.NET and building out their own API server.

### Module 3 - MVC & Entity Framework Core

1. Relational Databases & schemas
1. CRUD Intro to Entity Framework
1. Dependency Injection
1. Navigation Properties, Routing

1. Testing and Swagger
1. Authentication with Identity Framework
1. Authorization with Identity Framework

Midterm Project Kickoff

## Midterm Project

1. Build a Full CRUD web app
1. Build a custom API
1. Make the Web app call out to the API

## E-Commerce Project: Dashboard

The second half starts with (2) 1-week sprints. Each week is broken into daily milestones.  Each milestone consists of 3-5 user stories that are divided amongst all developers
in a team.

Each day, the developers will complete their respective user stories. Each day builds off the prior, so it is important that all user stories from one day is completed before the next.

*Projects are only submitted at the end of each sprint* - This allows for students to progress towards an "end of week sprint" goal instead of feeling rushed everyday to complete the given tasks. This is also intentional to emulate a real-world team where in an agile environment, they are given until the end of the sprint to complete all the tasks that are assigned to them each day.

Students will use Azure Dev Ops (ADO) as their project management tool and Azure Repos as their source control. They will use the ADO Kanban board to create and manage user stories.

1. Managing a Sprint Backlog
1. Create User stories with tasks and Acceptance tests
1. Task Branching
