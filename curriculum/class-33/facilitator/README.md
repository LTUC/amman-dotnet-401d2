# Facilitators Guide: IEmailSender/Sendgrid

## Overview

SMTP servers (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) are used for the sending and receiving of emails. Sometimes we need to offset the use of sending emails to a 3rd party provider. This is what SendGrid is for. SendGrid is our 3rd party provider that will allow us to use it's platform to send emails to our consumers.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
At this point, the students should have a largely working E-Commerce site, with a CMS and a basic user experience where they've got items added to a cart, and a cart page created

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be doing the first of 2 integrations for the "Place Order" phase of the site. Following the clicking of the "Place Order" button, students will initate a number of emails, using **SendGrid**

**Where we're headed**:
In the next class, and the final phase of the build, students will integrate with **authorize.net** to add payment processing to their E-Commerce App.
