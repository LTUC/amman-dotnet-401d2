# Lab 32: Sprint 2 - Milestone #3

Your whole workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow.

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## User Stories & Guidance:

1. (Developer 1 & 2 & 3) As a developer, I would like to use other third party options to register and sign up for an account on the site so that I don't have to create a custom registration.

### Guidance

**User Story 1:** For each developer that is working on this project, incorporate one provider as an option for login/registration on the site. (example: 2 developers will mean 2 OAUTH/3rd party provider options)
