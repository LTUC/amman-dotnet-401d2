# Demos: Azure Blob Storage

Use this document to describe the demo(s). Generally, this is going to take the format of either how to build the demo step by step, or less specifically, talking points surrounding the outcomes of the demo segment and code snippets to highlight.

## Demo

Build up as follows:

1. Simple form with POST to an action
   - Note: You get the file name, but no file
1. Refactor: add multipart to the form
   - Note: You can now see a file
1. Save this to a local file
1. Save to Azure Blob
