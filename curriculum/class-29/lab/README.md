# E-Commerce Sprint 1 - Milestone 4:  Blob Storage

Work together with your partner(s) to complete this lab.

> NOTE: Your team workflow will live in Azure Dev Ops. Use this tool to store your project repository code, user stories, and general overall workflow.[Azure DevOps CheatSheet](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/curriculum/projects/ecommerce/azure-devops-cheatsheet)

Your team will be evaluated and graded at the end of every sprint for the individual milestones and overall presentation of the sprint/project. Each day the previous day's milestones build off each other as the project progresses. Stay on top of your work, **Communicate**, and work together.

## Admin Dashboard

When adding/editing products, we'll be adding the ability to upload an image for each product. We'll be storing these the cloud. Specifically, we'll be using **Azure Blob Storage Containers** which allow us to upload an image to remote storage and obtain a URL so we can eventually view them on a web page.

### User Stories and Tasks

Divide your work evenly amongst your team members.

1. As an administrator I would like upload a picture for each product so that my shoppers will know what our products look like
1. As an administrator I would like replace a picture for each product so that I can keep my inventory up to date
1. As an administrator, I would like a preview of my product listings so that I can see what my customers will see in the online store

### Guidance

- You will need to provision a **Blob Storage Instance** at Azure
- Ensure that you have the appropriate security settings in place

## Tests

1. Use a Mock or Simulator to test the upload process
