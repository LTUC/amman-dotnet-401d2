# Facilitators Guide: Xamarin: Forms & Data Services

## Overview

Using Xamarin Forms, we can save data either to the cloud (via APIs) or locally using SQLite or Files, allowing your application to persist state and store data

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class, we wired up a basic application, so the students should have a stable base from which to work.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be adding the ability to save data within our application. The primary focus will be on local data storage

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on tapping into device features such the accelerometer, maps, etc.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are getting data to save on the device. Remember that the students are building out their own applications, so the demo/lab provide guidance, but not specifics

## Preparation

- Read up on ...
- Practice the demo

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Code Review

### TOPIC 1

Continue to do your demo workshop or mob-programming style with the students. Because the demos are short, everyone should be able to follow along and enter their own lab time with a working self-written demo.
