# Facilitators Guide: React I

## Overview

Introduce students to NextJS and Tailwind.

Re/Introduce them to React and ES6 language features.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we reviewed Data Structures & Algorithms. Normally DSA days fall at end of module, but I like to move it up to enable folks taking their white boards a little sooner.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be introducing a huge paradigm shift in front end development.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class will focus on going deeper with NextJS basics.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are the ability to create a basic react application.

## Preparation

- Read up on latest content in [Main Concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) section of React site.
- Get ready for questions about...
  - I really saw `map` etc. in 301?
  - What the heck is this JSX stuff?
- Practice [demo](../demo/magic-eight-ball)

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Code Review

- Last class was a review day to hopefully little to no review. Which is a good thing, because there is a lot to cover.

### ES6 Features

- **Why**
  - JavaScript went a LONG time between updates before ES6. Consequently, ES6 (aka ES 2015) has a LOT of changes that devs had been clamboring for years to get.
- **What**
  - let/const
  - arrow functions
  - template literal notation
  - multi-line strings
  - for of / for in
- **How**
  - Demo out each feature
  - Discuss pros (and cons if needed) of each feature.

### React

- **Why**
  - Discuss limitations of "classic" web sites where each page was a fresh load
  - Discuss move to "Single Page Applications"
  - Discuss React moving into lead
- **What**
  - JSX
  - Rendering elements
  - Components & Props
  - State & Lifecycle
  - Handling Events
- **How**
  - The readings for class covered all the **what** items listed above.
  - The demo will show them in action.

### NextJS

- **Why**
  - React insists that it is **NOT** a framework.
  - React intentionally leaves many decisions up to the developer.
  - Which can lead to "reinventing the wheel" when you start a new React project.
- **What**
  - Next.js IS a framework.
  - Though it's still React under the hood.
  - Next.js makes a lot of smart choices for us.
- **How**
  - The `create-next-app` command gets you up and running quickly.
  - Alternately can use an online tool like [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)

## Lab Notes

- There is a LOT to cover today so keep an eye on time.
- Encourage students to consult the extendsive docs on Next, React, and ES6.

## What might students struggle with today?

- Scale of new concepts.
  - It's ok for them to feel overwhelmed. It takes practice to switch between languages/stacks.
- Student my be rusty on the React & ES6 features covered in 301.
