# Demo: Entity Framework and APIs

## Entity Framework Setup: Guided Workshop

Code this out as a workshop with the students, allowing them to "feel" each part of the scaffolding as you go. There's a lot of boilerplate here, both given to you by Microsoft and that you'll have to implement on your own, which is the same for every app.

Conduct this demo in 2 parts, using the "School" problem domain.

Begin by showing the [build checklist](../resources/ef-web-app.md). They will follow this later ... but make sure you have it up and visible during your demo so that the students can see the process unfold, and predict next steps more easily

1. Build the full application, explaining as you go, as you normally would
   - Finish with a working "API" that can hit a route
1. Break the students up into small groups, and have them re-create the demo themselves, following the steps.
   - Have them follow each "Phase" of the workshop checklist and then check in with you as to their progress.
   - It helps to have your TAs guiding a small group through this so that it goes quicker.

At the end, they will have both witnessed and created the days' demo

When they begin lab, they should have a great starting point to execute the same code, but using the **Async Inn models** as directed by the lab.
