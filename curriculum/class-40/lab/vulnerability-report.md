# Vulnerability-Report

## Assignment:
- Review the [.NET OWASP Top 10](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/.NET_Security_Cheat_Sheet).
- Review your E-Commerce Project and do a security vulnerability review.
- create a `vulnerability-report.md` file inside your E-Commerce site to document your identified vulnerabilities.
- Evaluate a **minimum** of 4 different vulnerabilities that your site is protected against.
	- Report on:
		- what a vulnerability would like in your site (provide code examples specific for .NET Core),
		- how to identify it
		- what code is required to fix it//What did .NET Core do to help you with this fix?
		- Is this an issue in .NET Core?
	- **Do not just copy and paste the vulnerability specific text**. Put it in your own words, explain it, learn from it.
	- Reference any resources that you used to assist with the vulnerability report


## Example:

## Vulnerability 1
### Exposure
[vulnerability 1] is something that does ABC when someone does XYZ by typing some relevant code into some vulnerable field OR by doing some edge-case thing.</p>


[this vulnerability] would have had XYZ effects on our site and potentially allow the retrieval of XYZ attributes from the site / access to some unauthorized part of the site / something else valuable.

### Repair
problem_file1.cs and problem_file2.cshtml contained the vulnerability. We were able to fix the first with the following adjustment(s):

[specific fixes here]
