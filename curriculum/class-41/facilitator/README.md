# Facilitators Guide: Unity

## Overview

We'll be starting a short series of classes on game development with the Unity game engine. This should present an excellent opportunity for students to cement their knowledge of C# and use that in a completely different development environment and application type.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
At this point, the students should have a firm grasp on C# fundamentals. This should allow them to be comfortable in applying both Object Oriented and Functional code to game events.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be introducing the students to the Unity environment, ecosystem, and architecture. Thinking about game development in 2D and 3D is entirely different than a typical full stack application.

**Where we're headed**:
In the next class, students will explore Physics (gravity, momentum), character movement, and collisions. They will then have 2 class days to complete the development of their own game.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

> Our primary outcomes and goals for the day are for the students to gain some basic familiarity with the Unity development environment and some fundamental understanding of the complexity of architecting a game, thinking wide about the map, movements, actions, and game play ... and how that's going to impact their code and approach.

## Preparation

- Practice the Unity Tutorial as noted in [the demo](./DEMO.md).
  - Multiple times!
- Be familiar with common mistakes the students are likely to make and how to recover from them.
- Understand the .gitignore and be ready to talk through all of the files that change as you use the game inspector

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](../LECTURE-NOTES.md) notes.

### Code Review

- This is the start of a new Module. No code review required

### TOPIC 1: Game Development

- **Why** (5 min)
  - This is totally different than a typical "Full Stack" application
  - We need to think in multiple dimensions and non-linearly
- **What** (10 min)
  - Nothing in a game happens sequentially
  - User Input (events) drive everything
  - Many facets to consider
    - Multiple characters
    - Multiple screens
    - Motion, Gravity, Collisions
    - Getting User Input
- **How** (30 min)
  - This is a good opportunity to show still shots of games and pick out the elements, describe the complexity, and strategize architecture

### TOPIC 2: The Unity Environment

- **Why** (5 min)
  - Knowing your tools is critical!
- **What** (10 min)
  - Creating a virtual world
  - Planning/Placing/Operating characters
- **How** (30 min)
  - How/Where does the GUI generate code?
  - How/Where do we write code in response to user interaction?
- **Experimentation and Discovery Ideas**
  - Live code and develop the Unity 2D Tutorial

## Lab Notes

- Day 1 of game development
- Help the students with selecting an achievable idea. They will have 4 lab sessions to conceive, prep, and complete.

## What might students struggle with today?

- Getting their environment setup and ready to develop with
- Attaching code to the inspector

## Past bugs, issues or surprises...
